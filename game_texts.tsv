3630	The Abrahamskraal Formation in South Africa dates back around 259-268 million years and is part of the Karoo Supergroup, a rock formation that covers almost two-thirds of the country. It is famed in the paleontology community for housing a vast array of dinosaur fossils – the remains of many early dinocephalians, gorgonopsians and therocephalians have been recovered from the Abrahamskraal Formation, as well as the only known examples of the synapsid Elliotsmithia. <br><br>This formation is made primarily of mudstone and sandstone and incorporates both the Tapinocephalus and Eodicynodon Assemblage Zones – areas that are known to hold an abundance of Tapinocephalus (a large, herbivorous dinocephalian) and Eodicynodon (an herbivorous synapsid notable for its pronounced snout). The Abrahamskraal Formation lies between the Teekloof Formation and the Ecca Group, and ranges in color from greenish-grey to reddish-brown. <br><br>While the Abrahamskraal Formation is primarily known for the range of dinosaur fossils within its rocks, it also contains a variety of historical flora and fauna, including the plants Dadoxylon and Schizoneura africana, early amphibians such as Rhinesuchus, molluscs and fish.
3631	The Antlers Formation is large stratum underlying parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas. The formation primarily consists of mudstone, clays and sandstone. It dates to around 115 million years ago and is roughly 150m thick. A number of different fish, reptiles, amphibians and early mammals have been found here but the most famous finds are those of the dinosaur Acrocanthosaurus. One specimen recovered here is the largest so far discovered and also contains the only complete skull. <br><br>The formation is a contemporary of the nearby Twin Mountains Formation and they are both contained within the Trinity Group of strata. Acrocanthosaurus and certain other dinosaur fossils can be found in both formations, indicating they are examples of a similar environment and time period.
3632	The Bahariya Formation is a collection of rock strata located in the Western Desert region of Egypt. The El Heiz and El Naqb Formations sit above it and the basement underneath. It was named after the nearby Bahariya Oasis by Said in 1962. The stratigraphic range dates to the early Cenomanian, around 100 to 94 million years ago. <br><br>It forms the base of a vast depression, and the sediment is formed through successive layers from rises and falls in sea level. It is primarily sandstone, with siltstone and mudstone also in evidence. <br><br>This site is known as one of the most productive fossil sites in Africa. As such a wide variety of finds originate from the Bahariya Formation, including lepidosaurs, sauropods, and theropods. Fish fossils are abundant here, including giant predatory fish. Despite this known richness of finds, it remains one of the least studied.
3633	Dating back around 86-102 million years to the Cretaceous period, the Baynshire Formation – also know as the Bayan Shireh Formation – is a body of rock found in northern Mongolia. The formation overlies the Baruunbayan Formation and underlies the Javkhlant Formation, and is made up primarily of claystone and sandstone, reaching a thickness of around 300m. <br><br>The Baynshire Formation is famed for its incredible biodiversity; it is the location of a huge number of fossil finds, with a rich variety of dinosaur remains recovered from the site including the large ornithomimosaur Deinocheirus, which can grow up to 11m in length and over seven tons in weight. Experts believe the majority of the region’s paleofauna dates back to the Turonian and Early Campanian stages of the late Cretaceous period. <br><br>The hadrosauroid Gobihadros was discovered in the Baynshire Formation in 2019, while other genera found include the ankylosaurids Maleevus and Amtosaurus, various sauropods and the ceratopsian Graciliceratops. The site is also notable for housing the remains of many pterosaurs, turtles, mammals and fish, making it a popular site for paleontological excavations.
3634	The Bissekty Formation is located at the Dzharakuduk escarpment in the Kyzl Kum desert in Uzbekistan. It underlies the Aitym Formation and sits above the Dzheirantui Formation. The formation dates to the Turonian to Coniacian stages of the Late Cretaceous epoch, 90 million years ago. It comprises of two units: <br><br>This formation was formed from a coastal region from the receding sea of the earlier period, and then once again under the sea in the next. It is primarily composed of sandstone. <br><br>Some of the oldest ornithomimid theropod dinosaur remains are known from this site. It’s also known as the richest site of Turonian terrestrial fauna known from Eurasia. Therian fauna including one stem marsupial are also common here. <br><br>A wide range of marine, freshwater, and terrestrial fossils have been recovered from this region. This includes arthropods, molluscs, turtles, amphibians, fish, crocodylomorphs, lizards, mammals and dinosaurs.
3635	The Bone Valley Formation is located in Florida, on the south east coast of the United States, and is significant in the world of palaeontology thanks to the vast array of fossils that have been uncovered at the site. The formation, which dates back around 10-15 million years to the Miocene era, has a grey-brown appearance due to its composition of sand, marl and clay, and it can reach a thickness of up to 30 metres. <br><br>This formation is the site of a rich variety of different species - most of which existed long after dinosaurs died out. Examples of prehistoric turtles, horses and cats have been recovered by local explorers, and because the Bone Valley Formation is rich in phosphates, most of the specimens reclaimed are extremely well-preserved. <br><br>Of all the animals recovered from the Bone Valley Formation, the most exciting is surely Megalodon. This giant shark can grow to more than 16 metres long, and is one of the most fearsome predators the world has ever seen. Specimens excavated from the formation include a number of baby Megalodon teeth.
3636	The Candeleros Formation is situated in the Rio Negro, Neuquén and Mendoza provinces in Argentina. The formation was named after the Candeleros Hill located nearby. It is the oldest member of the Neuquén Group, and sits beneath the Huincul Formation and above the Lohan Cura Formation. It dates to the Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous epoch, 100 million years ago. <br><br>The formation was formed from a complex river system and is mostly comprised of sandstone and conglomerates.

3649	The Djadochta Formation is a geological formation located in the Gobi Desert, Central Asia and is famed for the huge number of dinosaur fossils contained within it. Made up primarily of sandstone and mudstone, the Djadochta Formation has two distinct members – the lower Bayn Dzak member, notable for its striking reddish-orange color, and the upper Turgrugyin member, which has a pale, orange-grey hue. <br><br>This formation dates back around 71-75 million years to the Late Cretaceous period and is home to an incredible variety of fossils from this era. Archaeological research of the area has uncovered the remains of prehistoric turtles, amphibians, lizard and mammals, as well as the pterosaur Azhdarchidae – but the Djadochta Formation is best known for the range of dinosaur fossils it holds.<br><br>The most commonly found dinosaur in the Djadochta Formation is the powerful herbivore Protoceratops – however this site has also unearthed examples of Pinacosaurus and Velociraptor, not to mention indeterminate species of Sauropoda, Tyrannosauridae and Troodontidae. In total, more than 40 different genera of dinosaur have been discovered in the Djadochta Formation.
3650	Egg Mountain is a site of particular interest and an outcropping of the Two Medicine Formation in Montana. It is situated just south of the town of Choteau. The site dates to the Late Cretaceous, around 80 million years ago. <br><br>The site is primarily sandstone, and was once a seasonal semi-arid environment – likely to have been a coastal plane along the edge of the Cretaceous Interior Seaway. <br><br>In 1978, Marion Brandvold discovered some bones that Jack Horner and Bob Makela identified as a new species of hadrosaur that they named Maiasaura. The site contains the highest concentration of dinosaur discoveries ever found, including a number of egg, foetal, baby and juvenile specimens. The finds provided the first evidence that dinosaurs cared for their young, and that inspired the name of the new dinosaur species. Remains of mammals, and lizards have also been recovered from this location.
3651	The Fox Hills Formation in North America runs from Alberta, Canada to Colorado, USA, and dates back around 70 million years. Overlain by the famous Hell Creek Formation in Montana, the Fox Hills Formation is the top formation of the Upper Cretaceous series, and is named after the Fox Hills of Fort Pierre, South Dakota. <br><br>Made up mainly of yellow and grey sandstone, this formation is home to a number of different dinosaurs and reptiles including tyrannosaurs and large marine predators from the mosasaur family, although it is equally well-known for the huge number of ammonite fossils it has preserved.
3652	The Frenchman Formation is situated in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin in the southern Saskatchewan and the Cypress Hills of south-eastern Alberta. Its name comes from the Frenchmen River and was named by G. M. Furnival in 1942. It underlies the Ravenscrag Formation, and overlies the Battle, Whitemud, Eastend, and Bearclaw Formations. It dates back to the late Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, 70 million years ago. <br><br>The formation primarily consists of sandstone, but with claystone and clay-cast conglomerate deposits as well. Its widest reported thickness is 113 meters. <br><br>paleoclimate estimates for this formation are 12–14 degrees centigrade, so indicating a subtropical climate.<br><br>Abundant remains of Triceratops (of varying ages) and other ceratopsids have been found here, along with other dinosaur fauna, as well as amphibians and fish.

3654	Garden Park is located in Colorado and is now more formally known as the Garden Park paleontological Resource Area. The region is part of the larger Morrison Formation and dates to the Jurassic epoch, 160 million years ago. The region is known from the Jurassic finds and the Bone Wars of the late 19th century.<br><br>The upper unit of the formation is mostly mudstone, with some sandstone. The lower layer is red mudstone, but also with some thin sandstone deposits. Garden Park was formed by the erosion of rock as the Rocky Mountains were formed. <br><br>The Felch Quarry 1 site is noted for the number of holotype specimens discovered. Holotypes are single specimens from which the species is formally described. <br><br>The various quarries in the region have proved to be a rich source of dinosaur finds, as well as reptile, amphibian, mammal, and osteichthyes fossils.
3655	The Ghost Formation can be found in New Mexico, USA and forms part of the Ghost Ranch, a large education center run by the Presbyterian Church. The formation dates back around 200 million years and is famed for the number of fossils that have been unearthed from its sediment, with almost a thousand individual specimens found. <br><br>During the 20th Century, the respected paleontologist Edwin H. Colbert studied the area, finding a huge number of examples of a single genus, Coelophysis. Subsequent analysis of the Ghost Formation has uncovered a wide range of other genera, including numerous theropod dinosaurs.
3656	Dating back to the Late Permian and Early Triassic period, the Guodikeng Formation is part of the Jilicao Group and can be found in Xinjiang, in the northwest of China. This formation is primarily made up of grey, purple and green mudstone, though it also contains siltstone and sandstone. It is overlain by the Jiucaiyuan Formation and reaches a thickness of over 200m on the north limb of the Dalongkou anticline. <br><br>The Guodikeng Formation is a hotbed of paleontological discoveries, featuring a diverse range of fossils – genera including the dicynodont therapsids Jimusaria and Turfanodon and the pylaecephalid dicynodont Diictodon have all been unearthed from the formation. <br><br>The most famous dinosaur found within the Guodikeng Formation is Lystrosaurus, an herbivorous dicynodont therapsid that existed around 250m years ago, notable for its large tusk-like teeth and horned beak. Lystrosaurus remains have been excavated from the upper part of the Guodikeng Formation, although they are more commonly found in the overlying Jiucaiyuan Formation.
3657	The Hanson Formation can be found on Mount Kirkpatrick, a mountain in Antarctica that reaches almost 15,000 feet above sea level. Along with Snow Hill Formation, the Hanson Formation is one of just two rock groups in the area in which dinosaur remains have been found. <br><br>The formation dates back to the Late Cretaceous period, when the climate was very different to today with high humidity and temperatures of around 18 degrees. A wide range of dinosaurs and other animals have been unearthed from the Hanson Formation, from  small pterosaurs to large sauropods.
3658	The Hell Creek Formation is one of the most famous (and most studied) dinosaur fossil sites in the world. It spreads across Montana, North and South Dakota, and Wyoming. It’s named after the exposures found along Hell Creek near Jordan in Montana. The formation sits below the Fort Union Formation and above the Fox Hills Formation. Fossil remains span the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous and the Danian stage of the Paleogene, 65 million years ago. <br><br>The rock strata are mostly claystone and mudstone, with some sandstone. Crocodilian remains indicate a subtropical climate and a region of coastal plains, floodplains, and extensive rivers and pools. These ran into the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea that divided the North American continent during the Middle Cretaceous to early Paleogene period.<br><br>The Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana contains the greatest collection of fossils from the formation in the world.<br><br>Beyond the numerous dinosaur finds, invertebrate, amphibian, fish, reptile, turtle, lizard, snake and mammal fossils have been recovered here.

3661	The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is located in south-western Alberta. It underlies the Whitemud Formation and overlays the Bearpaw Formation. It is part of the larger Edmonton Group and dates to the Campanian to early Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous epoch, 72 and 66 million years ago. It’s named for the Horseshoe Canyon, a key feature of the Badlands.<br><br>The formation consists of a wide range of deposits, including sandstone, with mudstone, shale and coal also present. The formation includes floodplains, estuarine channels, coal swamps and marine waters. <br><br>The wide range of deposit types means that a large number of dinosaur species have been discovered here, along with mammal, reptile, amphibian, plant, fish and invertebrate fossils. The comparative lack of turtle and crocodilian remains indicates that there was a cooler climate at this formation, although a more recent study found that the reduced diversity was due to a change in the soil conditions.

3663	The Hythe Formation is a sub-unit of the Lower Greensand Group, a geological group which spans from the Wealden area in Sussex to the London-Brabant Massif in East Anglia. This formation dates from the Lower Cretaceous, and is primarily composed of sandstone, sand, mudstones, and limestones.
3664	The Sainte-Barbe pit, located in Bernissart, Belgium, and informally known as the 'Iguanodon Mines', was a coal mine that in 1878 was the source of a remarkable discovery: dozens of highly complete Iguanodon skeletons. At the time it was theorized that such a high concentration of multiple specimens in one area indicated that Iguanodon was a herd animal, though this is not the only explanation - it's possible multiple animals could have been drawn together and buried by a flash flood or mudslide.<br><br>The quarry was never fully excavated - even though at least 38 specimens were recovered - due to flooding problems, and disruption caused by World War 1.
3665	The Iren Dabasu Formation is situated in the Iren Nor region of Inner Mongolia and dates to the Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous, 100 million years ago. It overlies the Arshanto Formation. The first dinosaurs were discovered here in 1922, but as yet the collections haven’t been completely studied. <br><br>Combined studies from Canadian and Chinese teams in 1988 and 1990 renewed interest in the location for the variety of finds there.<br><br>The formation comprises of sandstone with claystone and siltstones mixed in. The deposits come from a network of broad rivers and streams. It likely had a humid climate and this may have contributed to the gigantism seen in dinosaurs compared to similar dig sites. <br><br>Dinosaur eggs and turtle fossils have been excavated here. It’s also a rich source of dinosaur and microfossil finds.
3666	The Ischigualasto Formation is situated in the San Juan province in north-western Argentina. The formation spreads across the Ischigualasto Provincial Park and the Talampaya National Park.<br><br>The current geography of the Formation resembles the surface of an extraplanetary body, as such it has gained the name “Valley of the Moon” and its original name translates to “Dead Land”. The rocky desert of today would have once been a lush floodplain with a wide variety of flora and fauna.<br><br>The formation contains some of the best available fossils for the Late Triassic period, around 230 million years ago. It has produced valuable remains of Cynodonts, Rhynchosaurs and Pseudosuchians giving evidence of the evolution of mammals among other groups. Diverse flora discoveries here have helped fill out our picture of the Triassic ecosystem including many different species of fossilized plants and trees. Some of the earliest Dinosaurs discovered are also found in the Ischigualasto Formation, including the Herrerasaurus, which predates the traditional Saurischian-Ornithischian split in the dinosaur family tree and is a key and sometimes controversial piece in the development of Dinosauria.
3667	The Isle of Wight supports one of the richest dinosaur fossil locations in Europe. It contains elements from the Wessex Formation and the Wealden Group. It is located off the southern coast of the United Kingdom and dates to the Early Cretaceous epoch, 130 million years ago. <br><br>It was once situated where North Africa is today and remained stable for 10 million years. <br><br>The region was once a large coastal river valley including swamps and ponds, with a subtropical climate. Sediments of mudstone are dominant with some interbedded sandstone.<br><br>A large number of dinosaur remains have been recovered from what is one of the richest sites in Europe, with over 20 dinosaur species discovered. Dinosaur footprints can also be seen at Compton Bay. Bird, turtle, crocodile, and mammal fossils have also been found.
3668	The Jena Formation is one of six formations within the Muschelkalk group, and can be found in Thuringia, Germany. Dating back to the late Triassic period, approximately 200-230 million years ago, this formation reaches over 100m at its thickest point and is made up of layers of limestone, sandstone, mudstone, siltstone and shale, giving it a dull, greyish-brown color <br><br>This formation is significant from a paleontological point of view due to the large number of fossils that have been discovered within it. Although no dinosaur remains have yet been discovered within the Jena Formation, research has unearthed many ammonites and other early marine organisms such as bivalves and gastropods. <br><br>There is hope yet that further notable paleontological discoveries will be found within the Jena Formation, though. The underlying Röt Formation has produced a huge collection of reptile, fish and insect specimens, including early examples of Archosaur – ancestors of modern-day crocodiles!
3669	The Judith River Formation is situated in Montana and is a unit of the Judith River Group. It underlies the Bearpaw Formation and overlies the Claggett and Pakowki formations. The formation dates to the Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous, some 76 million years ago.<br><br>Its historical significance relates to dinosaur finds by early American paleontologists like Edward Drinker Cope.<br><br>A wide variety of fauna fossils have been recovered here, including fish, amphibians, crocodilians, lizards and a range of dinosaurs.
3670	The Jurassic Coast formation runs along the south coast of the United Kingdom, spanning almost 100 miles from Devon to Dorset. The formation is home to the celebrated fossil collector Mary Anning, who made a number of discoveries during the 19th Century. <br><br>The formation dates back around 185 million years and, due to coastal erosion, rock formations from the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous have been exposed. Frequent landslides on the coast have unearthed a huge variety of preserved fossils, from amphibians and crocodiles to pterosaurs and dinosaurs.

3672	The Kaiparowits Formation is found in the Kaiparowits Plateau in Southern Utah, and makes up part of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, alongside the Grand Staircase and the Canyons of the Escalante. This sedimentary rock formation dates back to the Late Cretaceous period.<br><br>Even though paleontologists have explored less than a tenth of the formation, it has been the origin of many species, the majority of which were new discoveries. It has been theorized that the reason for this rich diversity is a bountiful dense jungle ecosystem that reduced the need for herbivores - and the carnivores that hunted them - to migrate. This isolation allowed a unique collection of fauna and flora to develop.
3673	The Kayenta Formation is part of the Glen Canyon Group of formations that can be found in the western United States. Spanning Utah, Nevada, Arizona and Colorado, the formation can be up to 120m thick, with the remains of many animals preserved in the rock, from early crocodylomorphs and amphibians to dinosaurs. <br><br>This formation is most prominent in Utah, where layers of sandstone, limestone and shale have been deposited via streams over millions of years to create vast red and brown cliffs and broken ledges.
3674	The Kem Kem Beds can be found in southeastern Morocco, on the Algerian border. It dates back to the Late Cretaceous (100.5-66 Ma), and primarily consists of reddish rock.<br><br>This formation has come to be known for its wide variety of large carnivorous theropods. Despite the formation's reputation for carnivores, however, it is not necessarily the case that the ecosystems of the time had an unusually high concentration of carnivores living side by side. Theropod teeth are more desirable, and durable, and so appear more plentiful, but in reality these animals could have lived millions of years apart.
3675	The Kirtland Formation is located in the San Juan Basin in Colorado and New Mexico. It sits beneath the Ojo Alamo Formation and above the Fruitland Formation. It dates to the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous epoch, 73 million years ago. It was originally named the Kirtland Shale by Bauer in 1916.<br><br>The formation was formed from alluvial mud and sand deposits from the rivers and streams draining the coastal plain of the Western Interior Seaway. Coal and coal bed methane are also present here.<br><br>The first ceratopsid bones were unearthed here in 1910 and described by Barnum Brown. Several other expeditions recovered fragmentary remains. In 1997, a major effort by the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, and the State Museum of Pennsylvania conducted extensive surveys.<br><br>The location is the source of a variety of fossils including fish, Pterosaurs and turtles. It is known as one of the latest Cretaceous faunas in south-west North America.
3676	The La Amarga Formation runs along the west coast of Argentina, spanning the provinces Mendoza, Neuquén and Río Negro. The formation is around 160m thick and is composed of three Members - the Puesto Antigual Member, the Bañados de Caichigüe Member and the Piedra Parada Member - made up mostly of sandstone and mudstone. <br><br>The Puesto Antigual Member is particularly well-known for the number of tetrapod fossils preserved within it - excavation of the area has uncovered genera of stegosaur, diplodocoid and titanosaurian dinosaurs. <br><br>The La Amarga Formation is overlain by the Lohan Cura Formation and underlain by the marine Agrio Formation, and studies have shown that there was a time during which no sediment was preserved - meaning there is a period in the geological history of the formation which is currently unknown.
3677	The La Colonia Formation is situated in the north of the Chubut province in Argentina and dates back around 70 million years to the Late Cretaceous period. Experts believe the area had a lagoon or coastal plain environment at this time, with a warm climate and defined wet and dry seasons.  <br><br>Prolific paleontologist José Bonaparte made one of Argentina’s most famous dinosaur discoveries here when he unearthed a well preserved and fully articulated skeleton of the fearsome Carnotaurus. The remains recovered made it one of the most complete theropod specimens found in the southern hemisphere at the time of its discovery in 1984, and it is still the only example of this genus discovered. The La Colonia Formation also contains a wide variety of interesting vertebrate fauna, including lizards, snakes, turtles and plesiosaurs.
3678	The La Huérguina Formation dates back around 121-125 million years to the early Cretaceous period, and can be found in central Spain, not far from the city of Cuenca. The formation consists of limestone and marl and reaches 100m at its thickest point, overlying the Tragacete Formation and underlying the Contreras Formation. <br><br>This formation is notable not just for the number of prehistoric remains unearthed, but their quality. The conditions of the site allow for exceptional preservation of fossils, and many of the specimens recovered from the La Huérguina Formation have been excavated in one piece, with bones arranged in their correct order – making it much easier for experts to hypothesize about how they lived. <br><br>Perhaps the most important discovery the La Huérguina Formation has provided is the omnivorous dinosaur Pelecanimimus – ‘pelican mimic’ – which was first discovered in 1993. Pelecanimimus is notable for being the first ornithomimosaur to be found in Europe, allowing for a much more detailed understanding of the family. Other genera whose remains have been found in this formation include Concavenator, Iguanodon and the pterosaur Europejara.
3679	The Lance Formation is named after Lance Creek in Wyoming. The formation sits above the Meeteetse Formation and underneath the Fort Union Formation. It dates to the Maastrichtian age of the Late Cretaceous, 69 million years ago. It occurs above the ammonite marine zone in Wyoming, dated to 69 million years ago. The formation extends up to the K-Pg extinction event boundary.<br><br>The formation is comprised mainly of sandstone. The presence of some marine fossils indicate that it was a coastal plain along the Western Interior Seaway. Its climate was likely to have been subtropical with no indications of a cold season. <br><br>Many thousands of fossils have been recovered from this site, and amphibians, turtles, crocodiles, fish and mammals are present as well as dinosaurs.

3682	The Laramie Formation is in north-eastern Colorado. It underlies the Arapahoe Formation and overlies the Fox Hills Formation. It was named by Clarence King in 1876 for exposures in north-eastern Colorado. The site dates to Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous epoch, 70 million years ago. <br><br>The formation consists of sandstone, mudstone and clay with the deposits from a coastal plain and swamps on the shore of the Western Interior Seaway. The lower member comprises of sandstone, clay and coal. The upper member features mudstone , sandstone and coal beds.<br><br>As well as numerous dinosaur finds, the site includes fish, plant, crocodile, turtle and mammal fossils. Significant plant finds have also been found here including fossil pollen for gymnosperms and angiosperm. The shale and sandstones also provide leaf fossils for angiosperms, ferns and palms. Conifer fossils are rare at this site.
3683	The Lost Burro Gap dates back around 360-380 million years to the Mid-Late Devonian period, and is located in the Mojave desert, California. Primarily made up of sedimentary rock dolomite, the Lost Burro Gap (also known as the Lost Burro Formation) has a rich brown hue and lies between the overlying Tin Mountain Limestone and the underlying Hidden Valley Dolomite formations. <br><br>Palaeontologists have unearthed a wide array of animals from the Lost Burro Gap, primarily marine life – the remains of various prehistoric fish have been discovered in the formation, including the giant prehistoric fish Dunkleosteus. At up to 10m in length and weighing as much as four tons, Dunkleosteus was the apex predator of this environment during the Late Devonian period. <br><br>This formation takes its unusual name from the story of a local prospector named Bert Shively, who is said to have discovered a gold mine while searching for his lost burro (a breed of donkey native to the southwestern United States).
3684	The Lourinhã Formation lies on the western coast of Portugal and is named for the municipality where it is located. The formation dates to the Late Jurassic epoch, 150 million years ago. <br><br>The site contains fauna similar to that found at the Morrison Formation in the United States and the Tendaguru beds in Tanzania. Tide-influenced fluvial and tidal-bore deposits are also present, indicating a coastal environment.<br><br>A wide range of dinosaur remains have been found here along with fossil tracks and dinosaur eggs. Dinosaur eggs were found in the lower Amoreira-Porto Novo member, Praia Azul member and Bombarral member. Many recovered eggs contained embryonic material, and the Lourinhã Formation has the oldest sauropod and theropod nest with embryos known so far. Insect and mammal remains have also been unearthed.

3686	The Lower Lufeng Series (also known as the Lower Lufeng Formation) is found in Yunnan, China. It consists of two units of Dull Purplish Beds and Dark Red Beds, dating to the Hettangian and Sinemurian stages of the Early Jurassic, 201 and 199 million years ago respectively. <br><br>The first dinosaur fossils were discovered here in 1938 by geologist Bian Meinian and technician Wang Cunyi. In 2004, the area became listed as China’s National Geopark. It was then opened for visitors in 2008. <br><br>The sediments formed an alluvial plain of sandstone and mudstone.<br><br>In 2008 the first dinosaur footprints in the formation were discovered near the village of Yaozhan. Since then other footprints have been discovered in the locality. <br><br>Finds such as crurotarsi, tritylodont, crocodylomorph and mammaliaforme fossils have been recovered.
3687	The Maastricht Formation dates back to the Late Cretaceous period, and can be found in the Netherlands and Belgium. It is made up of chalk, marl and flint, and gets its name from the Dutch city of Maastricht, in the south east of the country. <br><br>A large number of dinosaurs, mosasaurs and mammals have been excavated from the formation, which is made up of seven Members: the Meerssen Member, Nekum Member, Emael Member, Schiepersberg Members, Gronsveld Member, Valkenburg Member and Kunrade Member. The formation lies between the Houthem Formation and the Gulpen Formation, and is believed to be around 66-70 million years old.
3688	The Mackunda Formation is a fossil site in Queensland, Australia. It underlies the Winton Formation and overlies the Oodnadatta, Allaru and Wilgunya Formations. It dates to the Cenomanian stage of the Late Cretaceous epoch, 100 million years ago, and is associated with the Winton Formation. <br><br>The formation comprises of interbedded sand, silt, shale, and calcareous shale. It is a marine deposit having been laid down in a shallow sea. At this time Australia was still connected to the Antarctic and would have suffered dark winters, with the climate being much milder than present day. The region included conifer forests along the coast of the Eromanga inland sea.<br><br>Vegetation such as conifers are present here and various dinosaur remains have been recovered from this location.
3689	The Maevarano Formation is located in the Mahajanga Province of north-western Madagascar. It was first explored by Dr. Félix Salètes and his staff officer Landillon in 1895. It dates to the Maastrichtian age of the Late Cretaceous, 70 million years ago. It underlies the Berivotra Formation and above the Marovoay Beds .<br><br>The formation is formed from deposits of sandstone, claystone and siltstone from a semi-arid environment (although with wet seasons) with a bordering sea. It supported broad and shallow rivers and floodplains with plentiful vegetation.<br><br>The site has proven to be a rich source of fossils including mammals, amphibians, fish, birds, snakes, and crocodylomorphs, mammals, as well as apex predator dinosaurs of their time. <br><br>Lungfish burrows discovered in the formation provide the first evidence for lungfish in the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana.
3690	Minchinhampton is a small town in Gloucestershire, England near which the only remains, so far discovered, of Proceratosaurus were found. The discovery of a partial skull was made in the opening years of the 20th century during the digging of a new reservoir near the town. The site forms part of the wider Great Oolite Group that underlies large parts of southern England.<br><br>Proceratosaurus would have roamed on the northern continent of Laurasia during the middle Jurassic, around 168 million years ago. It has recently been classified as one of the oldest known Tyrannosaurids.
3691	The Morrison Formation was named after Morrison, Colorado where the first fossils were recovered by Arthur Lakes in 1877. The region was one of the key locations for the Bone Wars during the late 19th century. It is a vast area of different layers covering 1.5 million square kilometers and covering Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. Elements spread further into other states. It dates to the Late Jurassic epoch, 156 million years ago. <br><br>The deposits of sandstone, mudstone, siltstone, and limestone formed from rivers and floodplains. There is evidence that large areas were once a dry climate, similar to a savannah, but with ancient plants rather than the more familiar grasses.<br><br>This is one of the most productive fossil sites in North America. Significant plant fossils have been found, along with insects, fish, crocodiles, lizards and clams.

3695	The Nanxiong Formation in Guangdong Province, China dates back to the Late Cretaceous period around 66m years ago, and is one of the most prolific producers of fossils in the country. <br><br>The formation is 300m thick and has unearthed many theropod, sauropod and ornithopod specimens as well as the remains of early crocodiles and turtles - although it is best known for the quantity of large carnivores it has preserved. <br><br>The presence of ferric oxides in the rocks gives them a dark red appearance - these 'red beds' are made up primarily of sandstone, mudstone and siltstone, and overlie the Jurassic granite basement.
3696	The Navajo Sandstone Formation is part of the Glen Canyon Group and can be found in the south west of the United States, spanning Utah, Colorado, Nevada and Arizona. There is some debate over the exact age of the formation, but experts believe it dates back around 190 to 200 million years to the early Jurassic period. <br><br>As you might have guessed from the name, the Navajo Sandstone Formation is formed primarily of sandstone - although it also contains limestone and dolomite. The formation is up to 700 metres thick, with a colouring that varies by location due to the different ratios of rock types - from a deep orange-red to a much lighter pink hue. <br><br>A range of dinosaur genera have been unearthed from the Navajo Sandstone Formation, including the tiny scavenger Segisaurus and the predatory theropod Dilophosaurus. Notable for the two crests on its head (its name translates to ‘two-crested lizard’), Dilophosaurus was the largest genus of dinosaur in North America during this period, at around seven metres in length.
3697	The Nemegt Formation (also known as Nemegtskaya Svita) is situated in the Gobi desert in Mongolia. It overlies the Barun Goyot Formation. Although not precisely dated, the formation dates at least as far back as the Maastrichtian age of the Late Cretaceous, 70 million years ago. <br><br>The shales and sandstones of the formation are the remains of streams, rivers, lakes and floodplains. Remains of petrified wood and Araucariaceae conifers suggest the area supported great conifer forests and other vegetation. The sediments suggest a rich environment capable of sustaining abundant life. It was likely to have been a wet environment.<br><br>Remains of crocodiles, turtles and fish have been discovered here. Egg remains for at least two dinosaur species have been recovered. In 2007 the fossilized footprints of a large sauropod were discovered.

3699	The Niobrara Formation can be found across much of North America and is formed of two Members; the Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the Fort Hays Limestone Member. The formation is made up of chalk and shale deposits that flowed through the Western Interior Seaway, settling over the course of millions of years. <br><br>The Smoky Hill Chalk Member contains a huge number of fossils dating back to the Late Cretaceous period, when many genera of aquatic animals swam the Western Interior Seaway and avian dinosaurs flew in the skies above it. Non-avian dinosaur remains have also been unearthed from the formation, which researchers believe is the result of carcasses being washed into the sea during floods.
3700	The Oxford Clay Formation covers much of southeast England, stretching out from Dorset and all the way up to Yorkshire. It contains several Members which date from the middle Callovian to the Oxfordian stages of the Middle and Late Jurassic epochs, 166 and 160 million years ago. It overlies the Kellaways Formation and sits beneath the West Walton Formation.<br><br>The region records a range of environments, predominantly coastal and marine with mudstone, fissile shale and limestone. <br><br>Dinosaur eggs have been found here, particularly in the Lower Oxford Clay in Cambridgeshire. Fish and invertebrate fossils are also quite common. Most fossils originate from the upper faces of the Stewartby Member and the Weymouth Member. <br><br>The abundant marine fossils are likely due to a large part being below sea depth, and with warm and nutrient-rich water that supported a rich ecosystem. The deeper water would have been lacking in oxygen, and so lack in predation on the sea floor allowed more carcasses to become fossils.
3701	The Pardonet Formation is one of six divisions that form the Schooler Creek Group in British Columbia, western Canada, and dates back to the late Triassic period around 203-216 million years ago. It reaches a maximum thickness of 137 meters and is made up primarily of limestone and siltstone, giving it a dark brown-grey appearance. <br><br>This formation is most notable for the 2004 discovery of a new species of giant ichthyosaur which caused great debate in the paleontology community over its correct classification. Initially considered to be from the Shonisaurus genus, the discovery was later reclassified as belonging to the Shastasaurus family and named Shastasaurus sikanniensis, before the original classification was reinstated in 2013. <br><br>Although it is currently officially recognized as Shonisaurus, experts are still split on the correct classification to this day, but one thing is clear – at more than 20 meters in length, the fossil represents one of the largest marine reptiles ever found, generating much interest in further excavation of the Pardonet Formation.
3702	The Peay Sandstone Member is a sub-unit of the Frontier Formation which stretches across north-west Colorado, south-east Idaho, southern Montana, northern Utah and western Wyoming. The member is in the north-east Bighorn Basin, Wyoming. It dates back to the Late Cretaceous epoch, 100 million years ago. <br><br>The region's deposits are primarily grey sandstone, along with shale (both grey and carbonaceous) and bentonite. The sediments would have been deposited by rivers and streams feeding the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway. Some isolated sandstone bodies surrounded by marine mudrock in the Frontier Formation reveal a series of coastal islands. Evidence of waves from this period consolidate this conclusion.<br><br>Common finds here have been trace fossils, such as Thalassinoides (burrows made from various creatures such as fish or anemones), and Zoophycos (artefacts created by moving and feeding polychaete worms), along with vertebrate teeth.
3703	The Pierre Shale Group is found in eastern South Dakota and western Wyoming in the United States of America. During the Cretaceous period, this area would have been part of the Western Interior Seaway, a marine environment.<br><br>The Pierre is formed out of shale, sandstone, and bentonite. This group has been host to multiple fossil finds, including Pteranodon specimens, and the Cretaceous sea turtle Archelon.
3704	Found in the Neuquén and Rio Negro regions of Argentina, the Plottier Formation dates back around 85 million years to the late Cretaceous period. The formation, which reaches a thickness of up to 25m, is made up of a combination of claystone and sandstone - lending it a colouring that varies from pale brown to deep orange-red - and is just one of seven formations that make up the Neuquén Group. <br><br>The fossils of many genera of dinosaurs have been found within the Plottier formation, as well as many other species of animal. The area is particularly famed for the number of titanosaurid remains it has returned - including Notocolossus and Petrobrasauru and the friendly giant Antarctosaurus. <br><br>At around 30 metres in length and weighing more than 80 tonnes, Antarctosaurus is one of the largest dinosaurs ever to have existed, and the Antarctosaurus giganteus species was recovered from the Plottier Formation - its name doesn’t refer to Antarctica, it means ‘opposite of northern lizard’ in Greek, a reference to its southern location.
3705	The Prince Creek Formation is situated in Alaska and dates to the Late Cretaceous, some 78 million years ago. It overlies the Schrader Bluff Formation and sits beneath the Sagavanirktok Formation. <br><br>The deposits for this formation were formed during a greenhouse phase on a muddy coastal plain. The deposit comprises primarily of sandstone and mudstone, with other elements like siltstone and carbonaceous shale evident.<br><br>As well as ample flora fossils from trees, mosses and ferns, a a variety of birds and dinosaurs have been recovered here.
3706	The Romualdo Formation in the north-east of Brazil is part of the Santana Group, and consists of layers of mudstone, limestone and shale dating back to the Early Cretaceous period. There has been much debate about the exact age of the Romualdo Formation, but general consensus suggests it dates back around 112 million years. <br><br>The formation's unique taphonomy has provided some of the most well-preserved fossils ever found, including not just bones but softer remains as well. A wide array of genera have been discovered in the Romualdo formation, including numerous dinosaurs and pterosaurs - and the preserved stomach contents of fish fossils have allowed researchers to study not only individual genera, but their relationships with one another.
3707	The Scollard Formation is part of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin in south-western Alberta. The formation’s name is derived from the Scollard Canyon in Buffalo Jump Provincial Park. It lies beneath the Paskapoo Formation (until more recently considered as the uppermost member of the Edmonton Group) and above Battle Formation. It dates to the Maastrichtian age of the Late Cretaceous period, and Danian age of the Paleogene, 70 and 66 million years ago.<br><br>Deposits from the time of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event can be found here, meaning that the lower member records the end of the dinosaurs, and the upper member the dawn of mammals.<br><br>This formation consists of sandstone, shale, and siltstones. Mudstones and coal seams are also present, as well as bentonite clays. <br><br>The site has revealed several dinosaur species, a few mammal specimens, and plant fossils including ferns and conifers.
3708	The Scollard Formation is part of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin in south-western Alberta. The formation’s name is derived from the Scollard Canyon in Buffalo Jump Provincial Park. It lies beneath the Paskapoo Formation (until more recently considered as the uppermost member of the Edmonton Group) and above Battle Formation. It dates to the Maastrichtian age of the Late Cretaceous period, and Danian age of the Paleogene, 70 and 66 million years ago.<br><br>Deposits from the time of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event can be found here, meaning that the lower member records the end of the dinosaurs, and the upper member the dawn of mammals.<br><br>This formation consists of sandstone, shale, and siltstones. Mudstones and coal seams are also present, as well as bentonite clays. <br><br>The site has revealed several dinosaur species, a few mammal specimens, and plant fossils including ferns and conifers.
3709	The Shishugou Formation dates back about 160 million years to the late Jurassic period, and is famous for the abundance of theropod fossils held within it. The formation is located in Xinjiang, in the north-west of China, and is made primarily of mudstone that gives it a reddish hue. It lies between the underlying Kalaza Formation and the overlying Xishanyao Formation. <br><br>This formation is famed for so-called ‘death traps’ found throughout - pits of mudstone and sandstone containing a large number of dinosaur fossils. Experts believe that these are the result of large dinosaurs gradually wearing away the soft soil beneath them, with smaller dinosaurs then unable to climb out. <br><br>A wide variety of dinosaur genera have been recovered from the Shishugou Formation. Theropods and sauropods are especially well-represented - notable examples include the theropods Monolophosaurus and Zuolong and the sauropod Mamenchisaurus - one of the largest dinosaurs ever to have existed, at over 35 metres long.
3710	The Smokejack Clay Pit is located in Surrey, England and exposes part of the lower Weald Clay Group, which spreads across much of southern England and dates to the Early Cretaceous period. <br><br>The site came to prominence in 1983, when the chance find of a large claw by fossil hunter William Walker led to the uncovering of one of the most complete dinosaur specimens ever found in the United Kingdom. This new species was named Baryonyx walkeri after its heavy claw and the man who made the initial find. It was also one of the best examples of a spinosaurid found anywhere in the world, informing the study of similar dinosaurs including Suchomimus. <br><br>The site also serves as one of the best Weald Clay sites for reptile finds, preserving a wide array of crocodile teeth and coprolites. Other specimens excavated from the site include sharks, fish, insects and molluscs. An indeterminate large theropod tooth was recently found here, suggesting that further investigation of the Smokejack Clay Pit could provide further valuable finds.
3711	The Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the Fort Hays Limestone Member combined make up the Niobrara Formation, a Late Cretaceous period chalk formation that has been the origin of many Pteranodon discoveries. At the time it formed this area would have been deep and remote ocean not close to any land. As a result of this remoteness, most fossils found in the Niobrara chalk are marine reptiles such as mosasaurs. Still, some non-avian dinosaurs have been discovered. It is theorized that these dinosaurs were carried by floodwaters and currents to the open ocean.
3712	The Solnhofen Formation is found in modern day Bavaria in Germany, and is composed mainly of limestone. Multiple specimens have been uncovered in this area, often unintentionally in quarries.<br><br>This Jurassic rock represents a coastal environment featuring multiple salt water lagoons, which have preserved many fragile organisms that may have otherwise been destroyed by scavengers.
3713	The Taynton Limestone Formation in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom is famous for the rich variety of dinosaur fossils preserved within it - including the world's earliest named non-avian dinosaur, Megalosaurus. <br><br>The formation is made up mainly of limestone, sandstone and marl, dating back to the Middle Jurassic period approximately 170m years ago. Sitting between the Hampen and Rutland Formations and the Fuller's Earth, Sharp's Hill and Horsehay Sand Formations, the Taynton Limestone Formation is home to many other fossils, including early mammals and fish.
3714	The Tegama Beds are a component within the Elrhaz Formation near Agadez in Niger. It dates to the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous epoch, 120 million years ago. <br><br>It is primarily formed from coarse sandstone. The region would once have been a lush and swampy environment.<br><br>The site is most famous for the discovery of Suchomimus, a large spinosaurid dinosaur. The holotype for this species was recovered here by Paul Sereno in 1988. The area also holds fossilized plants, invertebrate and vertebrate (such as dinosaur and crocodylomorph) remains. Most of the vertebrate remains lie in the basal channel log deposits.
3715	The Tendaguru Formation is located in Tanzania and fossils were first discovered there by Bernhard Wilhelm Sattler in 1906. It dates to the Late Jurassic epoch, 150 million years ago. It was named for Tendaguru Hill where bones were first identified. This is one of the largest known Late Jurassic rock formations.<br><br>The formation is of terrestrial origin, with sandstone and shale deposits. It was most likely a semi-arid environment with waterways, rivers and pools. There was extensive vegetation there with ferns, cycads and conifers present. The climate would have become more humid as the Cretaceous period approached.<br><br>It is considered an analogous site to that of the Morrison Formation in North America, mainly because of similarities in species and diversity.<br><br>Dinosaur eggs and fossils have been recovered from this site.
3716	Located in the Hebei and Liaoning provinces of northern China, the Tiaojishan Formation is a geological formation known for being a prolific source of dinosaur remains. The formation dates back around 153-165 million years to the mid-late Jurassic period, and is made up primarily of andesite, a volcanic rock that lends the formation a grey coloring. Reaching a thickness of 2,420m, this formation is overlain by the Tuchengzi and Houcheng Formations and underlain by the Haifanggou Formation. <br><br>The Tiaojishan Formation is famed for the quality of its fossils as much as its quantity – excavations of the site frequently lead to the unearthing of near-perfect skeletons, with a wide array of dinosaurs, pterosaurs, lizards, cynodonts and arthropods found in excellent condition. <br><br>The pterosaur Jeholopterus was discovered within this formation, while other genera found at this site include the heterodontosaur Tianyulong and a number of bird-like dinosaurs called anchiornithids. Including Anchiornis, Xiaotingia and Aurornis. Experts believe that the region would have had a warm, humid climate during the mid-Jurassic period, ideal conditions for a diverse range of fauna to thrive.
3717	The Twin Mountains Formation is situated in northern Texas, forming part of the Trinity Group of strata which spreads under 5 other states in the USA. The formation largely consists of sands, clays and conglomerates. Its name is derived from two small peaks near the city of Stephenville in Texas and the formation is around 50m thick in that area. It underlies parts of the Glen Rose Formation in which a famous set of dinosaur footprints were discovered.<br><br>The formation dates to the Early Cretaceous period around 115 million years ago and has produced a number of indeterminate sauropod and theropod remains along with a partial skeleton of Acrocanthosaurus.
3718	The Udurchukan Formation forms part of the Tsagayan Group in south-eastern Russia. It underlies the Bureya Formation and sits upon the Kundur Formation. It dates from the Maastrichtian age of the Upper Cretaceous, 66-72 million years ago.<br><br>The formation comprises mainly of mudstone, conglomerate sedimentary rock, along with sand.<br><br>The area’s bone beds are best known for the hadrosaurid finds from a variety of species.
3719	The Vossenveld Formation is part of the Lower Muschelkalk sequence that stretches across much of western Europe and can be found in the small town of Winterswijk in the east of the Netherlands, near to the border with Germany. It dates back to the mid-Triassic period, around 242-247 million years ago. <br><br>This formation is made up primarily of limestone and mudstone, and is notable for the incredible variety of fauna and flora contained within in it – the remains of various prehistoric reptiles, fish, amphibians, insects and plants have all been found within the Vossenveld Formation. <br><br>Some of the most commonly found fossils belong to the Pachypleurosauria and Nothosauridae families, early aquatic reptiles with a similar appearance to modern-day marine lizards. Pachypleurosauria can grow to a length of around one meter, with paddle limbs and a long tail that aid swimming – a crucial defense against predators - while Nothosauridae are much bigger, growing up to three meters long. 
3720	The Xingezhuang Formation is situated in the province of Shandong near the city of Zhucheng. It is part of the Wangshi Group which dates to the Late Cretaceous. <br><br>A partial skull and frill of a new genus, Sinoceratops, was found here along with two different hadrosaurs and a tyrannosaurid. Sinoceratops is the only confirmed ceratopsid found so far in China. Dinosaurs found at this site are likely to have lived in a landscape of rivers, floodplains and alluvial fans.
3721	The Yixian Formation in Liaoning Province, north-eastern China dates back around 125 million years to the early Cretaceous period and is famous in the paleontology community for the quality of the specimens found within. It is made up primarily of basalt and sits between the Jiufotang Formation above and the Dabeigou and Tuchengzi Formations below. <br><br>The dinosaur remains recovered from the formation are often very well preserved, which experts attribute to a limnic eruption - an extremely rare form of natural disaster in which animals are suffocated by a cloud of poisonous carbon dioxide erupting from a deep lake, which creates excellent conditions for fossil preservation. <br><br>The formation is home to a huge number of dinosaur specimens of all shapes and sizes, from the large predator tyrannosauroid Yutyrannus to the tiny feathered compsognathid Sinosauropteryx. The remains of sauropods, theropods and ornithischians have been recovered from the Yixian Formation, as well as many pterosaurs, reptiles, mammals, fish and various flora – a diversity of fossils that makes it a popular location for paleontological digs.
3722	The Yuliangze Formation (also known as the Yuliangzi Formation) is located near Heilongjiang in China. It underlies the Taipinglinchang Formation and dates to the Maastrichtian age of the Late Cretaceous epoch, 69 million years ago. <br><br>Jiayin and Wulaga are two particularly rich fossil sites within this formation. The formation comprises mainly of sandstone and mudstone with fluvial deposits. Some conglomerate is also present. These indicate waterways or lakes and ponds. Coarse channel fills also suggest rivers.<br><br>Dinosaur fossils in this region are dominated by hadrosaurs, but other remains have been retrieved.
3723	The Ziliujing Formation is a sub-unit of the Dashanpu Formation in China and located in the Zigui Basin. The site was first discovered to contain fossils in the 1970s and it dates back to the Middle to Late Jurassic epochs, 168 million years ago. <br><br>An assemblage of 300 theropod and sauropod footprints were found in a region of what was likely to have been a tropical freshwater lake. In 1977, a dinosaur specimen was extracted that could be a possible evolutionary link between prosauropod and sauropod.<br><br>The region was once a dense forest and likely contained a large river that fed into a lake. <br><br>Fossils including amphibians, turtles, marine reptiles and fish were discovered here.

4744	Dinosaurs are now out in the world. A government agency, the DFW, have been called in to set up a containment facility in Arizona following a sighting.
4745	This area of Arizona desert is home to groups of wild dinosaurs. Even with a clear lack of buildable space and a hostile environment, the DFW wants to set up a new kind of operation. You are the one chosen to make sure this operation profits the organization. Can you pull it off?
4746	A dinosaur poacher ring has recently been broken up by the authorities and after a disaster at their camp, dangerous dinosaurs are now loose in the region.
4747	This poacher camp has been completely destroyed from within and whatever happened here left many dinosaurs roaming wild across the mountainside. The dinosaurs are suspected to have psychological trauma, do you have the skill to both heal the dinosaurs and turn this into a successful facility?
4748	With operations ongoing across the country, the DFW needs to establish a central headquarters to house all the newly captured dinosaurs. The nearby airstrip at this location makes it an ideal hub for long distance deliveries.
4749	The DFW has decided on this location for their central headquarters. This is your chance to manage it from the very beginning. Are you capable of taking care of all the dinosaur emergencies from across the country at the same time?
4750	There are reports of contested airspace in the Pacific Northwest and the DFW have been called in to capture flying reptiles to protect them and local air traffic. Plans have been made for a new purpose-built Aviary.
4751	This DFW base was used to capture flying reptiles. At some point it seems as if something went very wrong and the workers had to flee. Can you try again and make this a successful DFW facility to both take care of flying dinosaurs and make a profit?
4752	A large herd of wild dinosaurs have congregated in a valley inside Yosemite National Park. The DFW want to set up a facility here to catalogue and monitor the dinosaurs here as well as safely contain some dangerous species nearby.
4753	Yosemite National Park is now a haven for all kinds of dinosaurs to live freely in the wild. While this area is mostly forbidden for humans the DFW will be allowed to send a vehicle to take pictures for research purposes. You will only have a limited time to take those pictures. 
4754	A picturesque location in the Canadian mountains serving as home to several endangered species. The challenge found here may be beyond what its calming surroundings suggest.
4755	This picturesque Canadian mountain location is perfect to create an idyllic Sandbox park.
4756	A quiet location set on the coast of Germany at the edge of a large temperate forest. Rules against genetic modifications are strict here and only herbivores are allowed. Do you have what it takes to reach 5 stars?
4757	Return to this calm, coastal area where you can build a beautiful Sandbox park.
4758	Years ago this coast was going to be home to a burgeoning dinosaur park but the staff weren't quite up to the task. Mistakes were made and now the dinosaurs roam freely. Can you make a success of it this time?
4759	Back to the beach, and back to creating a wonderful Sandbox park without limits on the coast.
4760	Build a carnivore park at the top of the mountain. With breathtaking views to go with astonishing predators, drawing in thrill seekers and achieving 5 stars should be easy... Shouldn't it?
4761	With nothing to hold you back, you can create the park of your dreams in this mountain top setting.
4762	The desert is an unforgiving place, the land is hard and arid. Seemed like a good place for an illegal dinosaur breeding site but very few are still alive. Do you have the skills to build a park here and to reach 5 stars?
4763	Free of restrictions this desert Sandbox park is a blank slate that will allow you to create your ultimate vision.
4764	Build your own vision of Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, free of restrictions.
4765	Fledgling dinosaur park Jurassic Park has been struggling to make any return on the considerable investment made to build it. Perhaps a change of management could yet see its fortunes turned around?
4766	Build your own vision of Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, free of restrictions.
4767	Return to Jurassic Park: San Diego, where you can build a Sandbox park without limits.
4768	A new branch of Jurassic Park constructed on the mainland is missing its most important ingredient, dinosaurs. Shipping delays mean that the star attractions are yet to arrive, meanwhile the park is burning through capital and still needs to be prepared for the new arrivals.

5251	Splicing in different DNA can be used to give your dinosaurs unique pattern coloration.
5252	American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) DNA forms durable bony deposits (osteoderms) for tougher skin.\n\nThis genetic modification <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >increases the defense</font> of a dinosaur in turn <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >increasing dominance</font> and <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >improving combat effectiveness.</font>
5253	Vampire bat (Diaemus youngi) DNA can be used to develop powerful muscle tissues for the heart and lungs.\n\nThis genetic modification <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >increases the rate at which the dinosaur recovers stamina.</font>
5254	DNA from the Burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) helps dinosaurs adapt well to small spaces.\n\nIf this dinosaur is an <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >Alpha,</font> this genetic modification <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >reduces the environmental needs of all dinosaurs</font> in their territory.
5255	The DNA of green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) exhibits longer-lasting brain cells.\n\nThis genetic modification <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >increases the dinosaur's expected lifespan.</font>
5256	DNA from the rufous hummingbird (Selasphorus rufus) allows dinosaurs to process energy more efficiently, reducing the amount of food they need to eat.\n\nThis genetic modification <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >reduces the rate of health lost to starvation</font> and the <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >frequency of the dinosaur needing to eat.</font>
5257	DNA for stag beetle (Lucanus cervus) exoskeletons creates incredibly hard keratin for teeth and claws.\n\nThis genetic modification <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >increases the attack</font> of a dinosaur in turn <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >increasing dominance</font> and <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >improving combat effectiveness.</font>
5258	Grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) DNA reduces genome instability, which allows DNA to repair itself more effectively.\n\nThis genetic modification <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >reduces the rate of health lost to diseases</font> and the <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >chance of developing diseases.</font>
5259	Wolf (Canis lupus) DNA creates dinosaurs that feel more comfortable in groups of their own species. This genetic modification increases the dinosaur's dominance and the chance of the dinosaur socializing with other dinosaurs.\n\nIf the dinosaur is an <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >Alpha,</font> this genetic modification also <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >reduces the rate at which the Area Need grows with territory population.</font>
5260	DNA from the Arabian sand gazelle (Gazella marica) reduces the amount of water a dinosaur needs to drink to stay healthy. This desert-dwelling animal has the ability to shrink its liver and heart, lessening its reliance on water in extreme droughts.\n\nThis genetic modification <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >reduces the rate of health lost to dehydration</font> and the <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >frequency of the dinosaur needing to drink.</font>
5261	Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) DNA creates dinosaurs that thrive in groups containing other species.\n\nIf the dinosaur is an <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >Alpha,</font> this genetic modification <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >increases the amount of overlap the dinosaur is willing to tolerate</font> whilst <font face='$DescriptionFontBold' color='#EBF9FF'  >reducing the chance of attacking ranger teams.</font>

IF YOU USE THE GAME IN A COUNTRY OTHER THAN THE USA, THIS CLAUSE 12 DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br><br>This clause 12 will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If you and Frontier cannot resolve a dispute by informal negotiation within thirty (30) days of providing the other party with written notice of a dispute, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by final, binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

7367	At around 12m in length and more than six tons in weight, Acrocanthosaurus is one of the largest theropods and dates back to the Early Cretaceous period. This carnivorous dinosaur gets its name – which translates to ‘high-spined lizard’ – from the elongated spines running the length of its neck and back, while its sharp teeth and powerful jaw make it a fearsome predator comparable to the much more well-known Tyrannosaurus rex.
7368	A relative of the infamous Tyrannosaurus rex, Albertosaurus is a carnivorous theropod from the Late Cretaceous period. Believed to have been the apex predator of its time, Albertosaurus’ rows of razor-sharp teeth make light work of the smaller, herbivorous dinosaurs it preys on, while its sheer size – approximately 9.5m long and weighing around 4 tons – ensure other predators steer clear.
7369	Allosaurus is one of the most fearsome dinosaurs ever to have roamed the earth, weighing up to two and a half tons and measuring around 12m in length. The apex predator of the Late Jurassic period, Allosaurus’ enormous skull contains rows of large, serrated teeth for tearing flesh, while its long, powerful tail helps it to balance.
7370	Amargasaurus is named after the site of its discovery, La Amarga Formation in Argentina, and is an herbivorous dinosaur of the Dicraeosauridae family weighing around 2.9 tons and spanning 9.5m in length. Its long neck and sharp teeth allow it to eat tough vegetation from trees, while the two rows of long spines on its neck and back help Amargasaurus to defend itself from predators – an important characteristic given that this dinosaur has poor hearing and is unable to move at high speeds.
7371	Famed for its clubbed tail and the armor plates that cover its back, Ankylosaurus is a genus of Ankylosaurus that lived around 70m years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. Ankylosaurus’ protective osteoderms and robust build – the average specimen weighs 8 tons and is 9.6m in length - defend it from predators such as Tyrannosaurus rex, while its large stomach digested up to 60kg of ferns and shrubs every day.
7372	At over 20m in length and around 20 tons, Apatosaurus is one of the largest dinosaurs ever to have existed. This herbivorous Sauropod has a long neck that allows it to feed on the leaves of tall trees as well as lower-hanging plants, while the tip of its tail can be whipped to produce a loud bang that scares off predators.
7373	Archaeornithomimus is a genus of bird-like theropod, with a sharp beak and long hind legs. Its size – this dinosaur weighs between 100 and 200lbs and reaches around 3.3m in length – and physical features led to its name, which translates to ‘ancient bird mimic’. Archaeornithomimus had an omnivorous diet consisting of everything from plants to eggs and even other juvenile dinosaurs.
7374	Named after the esteemed British natural historian David Attenborough, Attenborosaurus is a genus of pliosaurid that grows up to 6.4m in length. Notable for its long neck and paddle-like limbs, this piscivorous marine reptile can move through the water at high speeds, catching prey with its long, sharp teeth.
7375	The large theropod Baryonyx can grow up to 10m in length and is notable for its crocodile-like jaws. Baryonyx is primarily a piscivore – although it lives on land, it can grab fish out of rivers with its long claws, and swim in shallow waters to catch prey with its long, serrated teeth. It is believed that Baryonyx is also a scavenger, feeding on the carcasses of smaller dinosaurs on land.
7376	
7377	
7378	Brachiosaurus is a genus of herbivorous sauropod and one of the largest dinosaurs to have lived, weighing in at over 50 tons. Thanks to its long neck, Brachiosaurus can feed on leaves from trees up to 12 meters high, eating up to 400kg of vegetation every day, while its vast size means any potential predators tend to steer clear. 
7379	Broken claws usually occur when the claw become snagged on the ground. They can be uncomfortable, making it more difficult for the dinosaur to walk and run - potentially leaving them open to predator attacks.
7380	While a broken wing can be very painful, it has further consequences. If an avian cannot fly, it leaves them prone to predator attack and unable to reach their nest or hunt for food.
7381	At a weight of over 51 tons and measuring more than 18m in length, the Camarasaurus is one of the largest sauropods and is easily recognized thanks to its distinctive blunt nose. Camarasaurus is a herbivorous sauropod and is related to more well-known dinosaurs including Diplodocus and Brachiosaurus. In fact, Camarasaurus is a more commonly found genus than its more famous relatives.
7382	Carcharodontosaurus is a carnivorous theropod dinosaur that existed during the Late Cretaceous period, around 95-100 million years ago. At around 15m in length, Carcharodontosaurus is one of the largest theropods, and gets its name – which translates to ‘jagged teeth lizard’ - from its teeth, which can grow up to eight inches. 
7383	Notable for the thick horns above its eyes, Carnotaurus is a theropod from the Late Cretaceous period. Weighing around 2 tons and spanning 10m in length with two rows of long, sharp teeth, this carnivorous dinosaur was the apex predator of its era – and the combination of its unique horns and flesh-ripping teeth gave Carnotaurus its name, meaning ‘meat-eating bull’.
7384	Cearadactylus is a genus of large pterosaur, with a wingspan of approximately 4-5 meters. Its long beak and thin, sharp teeth allow this piscivore to dip down into water and grab fish to eat, while its large eyes ensure it is always aware of any potential threats from nearby predators. This flying reptile’s full name (Cearadactylus atrox) translates to ‘Ceara’s lethal finger’, a reference to the location of its discovery and its sharp talons.
7385	At around 7m in length and just under one ton in weight, Ceratosaurus is an average-sized theropod from the Late Jurassic period. This carnivore is best known for the large horn on its snout and two further horns above its eyes, which gave rise to its name – Ceratosaurus translates to ‘horned lizard’.
7386	Ajay Sidhu was Roland Tembo’s friend and part of the team hired by InGen to recover dinosaurs from Isla Sorna in 1997. The dinosaurs were to be used as attractions in the planned San Diego park.\n\nSidhu was a skilled big game hunter and his experience was invaluable to the team. This didn’t prevent him from reaching a tragic end. Following a Tyrannosaur attack on the hunters’ camp, the group headed into long grass. Sidhu’s warnings to go around were ignored and he followed, trying to convince them to move to safer ground, but was killed by a pack of Velociraptors.
7387	Dr. Alan Grant was a world-renowned paleontologist who wrote the book Dinosaur Detectives, which Tim Murphy brought with him on his visit to Jurassic Park. After the 1993 Isla Nublar incident, Dr. Grant wrote another book about this experience.\n\nHe was working with Dr. Ellie Sattler at a dig site near Snakewater, Montana when John Hammond invited him to assess Jurassic Park before it was opened to the public.\n\nDr. Grant accepted the offer, although he didn’t know the nature of the park at that stage, in return for three years of funding for his dig site. He was amazed when he discovered what John Hammond's team had achieved. He saw a fascinating potential for observing them in life, and fitting them to his theoretical models.\n\nHe was one of the survivors of the 1993 Isla Nublar incident, and his knowledge of dinosaurs and their behavior was instrumental in their survival.\n\nDr. Grant's experiences jaded him, but he continued his work as a paleontologist at a dig site near Fort Peck Lake in Montana, working with Billy Brennan. Despite the public attention around his survival, he lectured to supplement the site’s funding.\n\nAmanda and Paul Kirby convinced Dr. Grant to act as a guide for a flyover of the island. He didn’t know their real intent, which was the rescue of their son trapped on Isla Sorna. An attack by a Spinosaurus meant Dr. Grant and Brennan were trapped on the island along with the Kirbys and their mercenaries. After finding Eric Kirby, Dr. Grant was one of the few to survive the 2001 Isla Sorna incident.\n\nIn the years to follow, Dr. Grant would continue his work as a renowned paleontologist Often found deep in a far-away dig site, he would continue to balance the irritation of tourists and sponsors with his life’s pursuit. When one day he received a visit from Dr. Sattler, asking him for his help with a disturbing new problem, he could hardly refuse.
7388	Amanda Kirby was Paul Kirby’s ex-wife. Together they deceived Dr. Alan Grant to act as a guide for a flyover of Isla Sorna, but in reality were searching for their missing son Eric and Amanda’s boyfriend Ben Hildebrand.\n\nTheir deception was discovered when they landed the plane and the group with them were revealed to be mercenaries. Amanda tried calling for her son, but attracted the attention of a Spinosaurus, which killed a mercenary and damaged the plane.\n\nAlthough they discovered Hildebrand was dead, Amanda eventually found her lost son with the help of Dr. Alan Grant, and while doing so adapted to the dangerous situations she encountered. This culminated in a face-off with the alpha of the Velociraptor pack where she returned the eggs stolen from their nest. The survivors were then rescued by the US Navy.
7389	Barry was a friend of Owen Grady and worked with him on the InGen security project to train the Velociraptor pack. He had a French background and knew Grady before InGen.\n\nHe demonstrated a close bond with Delta, one of the Velociraptor pack.\n\nAlong with Grady, Barry warned Vic Hoskins about the danger of trying to use the Velociraptors to hunt the Indominus rex. He was the first to realize that the Indominus rex and the Velociraptors were communicating. During the initial encounter, Barry was trapped in a log by Blue, but Grady distracted the raptor to allow Barry to escape.\n\nIn the years following the collapse of Jurassic World and the end of the Velociraptor training program, Barry returned to France to try and get away from dinosaurs. After the escape of species from Lockwood Manor and the arrival of dinosaurs onto the world stage, Barry's particular expertise became in demand once more.\n\nWorking for French Intelligence, Barry closely collaborated with the CIA to monitor and disrupt the new illegal underground of the dinosaur economy. He found himself alongside Franklin Webb, an ex-colleague from Jurassic World, when working a dangerous cargo bust in Malta.
7390	Ben Hildebrand was Amanda Kirby’s boyfriend after her divorce from Paul Kirby. He took her son Eric Kirby parasailing off the coast of Isla Sorna in May 2001. While enjoying their flight, they passed through some mist and discovered that the boat was now unmanned. He managed to disconnect the rope before the boat crashed into some rocks.\n\nHildebrand steered the parasail towards land where they crashed into a tree. He died, leaving Eric to survive alone on the island.\n\nHildebrand’s body was discovered by Dr. Alan Grant, Billy Brennan and Eric’s parents during their rescue mission.
7391	Benjamin Lockwood partnered John Hammond in the original creation of InGen. After the events at Jurassic World and the impending threat to the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar he puts a plan together to save the dinosaurs from the eruption. He still maintains significant business interests but these are generally managed by Eli Mills, with some overall guidance from Benjamin.\n\nHe cared deeply for his staff, notably Iris Carroll and Eli Mills and treated them as part of the family. His granddaughter, Maisie Lockwood, occupied most of his affection and he enjoyed spending time hearing about her latest imagined adventure.
7392	Billy Brennan was Dr. Alan Grant's site manager for the Fort Peck Lake dig site in Montana. He was an associate professor in paleontology.\n\nBrennan was instrumental in convincing Dr. Grant to join the Kirby parents for their trip to Isla Sorna, and so he was made to accompany them.\n\nAfter discovering the Velociraptor nest, he stole some of their eggs to later sell and help fund the dig site. This impacted his relationship with Dr. Grant.\n\nBrennan later saved Eric Kirby from a Pteranodon attack and was badly injured, although he did manage to survive the incident.
7393	Cabot Finch is a man obsessed with success. The former chief of public relations at Jurassic World, he now finds himself a senior official with the US Department of Fish and Wildlife. As the “wildlife” now includes dinosaurs, Cabot was brought on board as something of an expert. Also, his mother’s connections didn’t hurt. \n\nTwice divorced, and with an MBA from Yale (and privileged upbringing), Cabot sees himself as the man behind the scenes who keeps everything running and on schedule. He’d rather delegate than participate. On almost any task, but especially the more difficult and demanding ones, he prefers to stay at arm’s length. Out of the line of fire (and any potential bites). \n\nCabot is very much focused on the bottom line and is results oriented. He’s sarcastic, sometimes blunt, and often a little naïve about situations as they are unfolding. \n\nMore than anything else, Cabot is obsessed with power and seeing himself atop the chain of command. He’ll take credit for anything, and shamelessly shift blame for failure. Corporate through and through. Despite all of his faults, he’s somewhat likeable, and can be a sympathetic character at times. Usually when he’s not talking too much.
7394	Park operation manager for Jurassic World, and author of the Dearing Doctrine for the ethical paleo-curation of dinosaurs, Claire is famous for her actions during the Isla Nublar incident. Together with Owen Grady, Claire would help rescue many of the tourists stranded on the island, before barely escaping herself with Owen and her two nephews.\n\nPassionate and strong-willed, Claire has an unshakeable belief in the rights of the dinosaurs to be treated with care and respect.\n\nHowever, following her harrowing escape, she is now dedicated to changing how the rest of the world sees and understands dinosaurs. Claire’s message is equal parts hope and warning.\n\nClaire’s work with her Dinosaur Protection Group saw her returning to Isla Nublar after Mt. Sibo began to erupt and threaten the dinosaurs with extinction again. However, she soon realized she had been tricked by Eli Mills and the operation to rescue the dinosaurs had an entirely different motive. Claire and Owen barely made it off the island as it succumbed to the volcano and set to put a halt to the suspect operation being run under Benjamin Lockwood’s nose.\n\nAfter another narrow escape at the Lockwood Estate, Claire moved with Owen and Maisie Lockwood to live at Grady’s ranch in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. When a turn of events disrupted their quiet isolation, Claire was impelled into another international adventure. This time Maisie was at the top of Claire’s priority list.
7395	Dennis Nedry was the computer programmer tasked with setting up the computer systems to operate Jurassic Park. It was said to be the most advanced automation for any theme park ever. His financial problems encouraged him to strike a deal with Lewis Dodgson to steal some dinosaur embryos.\n\nHe covered his theft by disabling many of the park’s security systems. He then raced towards the docks to meet his contact, storing the embryos in a can of shaving cream provided by Dodgson. By this time, a storm had broken out and he crashed the Jeep. He attempted to recover the vehicle using its winch and lost his glasses.\n\nWith his eyesight compromised, he was surprised by a Dilophosaurus which spat venom at him, blinding him further. He dropped the can and was attacked and eaten by the Dilophosaurus.
7396	Dieter Stark was the second in command of Roland Tembo’s team of hunters, which was sent to Isla Sorna by InGen to retrieve dinosaurs for their San Diego theme park. He was assigned by InGen, not by Tembo, who didn’t trust him as much as he trusted Ajay Sidhu.\n\nAfter a successful day’s hunting, many of the dinosaurs were released by Nick Van Owen, with Tembo blaming Stark for the mess.\n\nFrom his early moments on the island Stark showed contempt for the dinosaurs, especially to the Compsognathus. Their revenge came when he left the camp and encountered a pack of them, which devoured him.
7397	Donald Gennaro was a lawyer representing the investors of Jurassic Park, and joined the assessment team in 1993.\n\nUntil he saw the dinosaurs, he warned John Hammond that in all likelihood the park would be shut down. His opinion changed after witnessing the Brachiosaur and Parasaurolophus herds, so much so that Gennaro expected they could charge whatever they wanted for park entrance.\n\nDuring the tour of the park, he sat with Lex and Tim Murphy. When the storm struck they started to return to the Visitor Center, but were stranded beside the Tyrannosaur paddock when Dennis Nedry cut the power.\n\nWhen the Tyrannosaurus rex tore through the fence, Gennaro abandoned the children to hide in a nearby restroom. Dr. Ian Malcolm attempted to distract the dinosaur but it charged the toilet instead, eating the lawyer.
7398	Eddie Carr was the equipment specialist for the team assigned by John Hammond to document the dinosaurs on Isla Sorna in 1997. He provided technical support for the expedition.\n\nCarr had a strained relationship with Dr. Ian Malcolm because of the scientist’s disregard for technology. However, when Dr. Malcolm, Dr. Harding and Nick Van Owen were trapped in the trailer by two Tyrannosaurs, Carr attached a winch cable from his vehicle to the trailer to prevent it falling off the cliff. Unfortunately the Tyrannosaurs spotted him, attacked his vehicle and killed him.
7399	Eli Mills was Benjamin Lockwood’s closest advisor and operated most of his business interests. He was young and ambitious for his role and Lockwood considers him his right-hand man. Like Iris Carroll he is considered more like family than a member of staff.
7400	Dr. Ellie Sattler was a paleobotanist who worked with Dr. Alan Grant and joined him in the assessment visit to Jurassic Park in 1993. She was one of the few survivors of the incident.\n\nAfter arriving on Isla Nublar, Dr. Sattler discovered plants at the side of the road that had long been extinct. On their tour through the park she helped to diagnose a sick Triceratops, tracing its illness to the lilac plants growing in the enclosure. As she stayed with the Triceratops, she missed the T. rex attack on the rest of the group and was able to return to the Visitor Centre.\n\nDr. Sattler accompanied Robert Muldoon to the site of the T. rex attack where they recovered the injured Dr. Ian Malcolm. As they returned to their vehicle the Tyrannosaur chased them, but they eventually outpaced her.\n\nLater, Dr. Sattler and Muldoon rebooted the system to restore the park systems and power, which allowed the Velociraptors to escape their secure pen. She managed to escape back to the Visitor Centre, but Muldoon wasn’t so lucky.\n\nShe was reunited with Dr. Grant and they rescued the children as they were hunted by the Velociraptors. Trapped in the lobby by the raptors, they were saved at the last moment as the Tyrannosaurus charged in, allowing the survivors to flee the building.\n\nEight years later, Dr. Sattler was contacted by Dr. Grant during the events on Isla Sorna. She was able to organize a rescue by the US Marine Corps.\n\nSince then, Dr. Sattler continued her ground-breaking work in paleobotany, spending her time investigating the impact of industrial farming on the environment. When requested to look into the unusual destruction of crops across the US by swarms of giant locusts, Dr. Sattler sensed that something insidious was at work. Her first port of call was paleontologist and old friend, Dr. Alan Grant. She persuaded him to team up once again to unravel the mystery of these strange events.
7401	Eric Kirby was the son of Amanda and Paul Kirby. He became trapped on Isla Sorna after a parasailing accident with Ben Hildebrand in 2001. Although only twelve years old, he managed to survive alone on the island for eight weeks.\n\nHis parents put together a rescue mission, but it was Eric who saved Dr. Alan Grant from a Velociraptor pack. As a dinosaur enthusiast, he recognized Dr. Grant, who later reunited him with his parents.\n\nAs they tried to escape the island, Eric was captured by a Pteranodon and taken to feed its young. Billy Brennan rescued the boy using Hildebrand’s parasail, reuniting him once again to his parents before they left the island.
7402	Franklin Webb was a MIT graduate hired by Claire Dearing to provide technical support for the Dinosaur Protection Group. He previously worked as an IT technician for Jurassic World. He joined the DPG despite his fear of the dinosaurs, and judged that their right to exist exceeded his own fears. His knowledge of social media and the World Wide Web helped increase the global coverage for the group’s campaign to save the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar.\n\nAfter his trip to Isla Nublar and brush with Mt. Sibo, Webb decided that he’d had enough of putting himself at risk for Claire’s dangerous methods. He left the DPG to take on a new role as a consulting analyst for the CIA Dangerous Species Unit. There he logged numerous incidents of dinosaur incursions across the US.\n\nWhen his new life is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of Claire and Owen, Webb once again found himself entangled in a perilous rescue mission.
7403	Stoic. Professional. Cool under pressure. If you ever find yourself in a foxhole, or staring down a Velociraptor, you want George Lambert beside you. \n\nBefore transitioning into security for Masrani Global, Lambert spent twenty years in the US military, where he was involved in a number of covert operations. This is where he gained his skills in both weapons and tracking. Married since he was nineteen, Lambert grew up in Mississippi, where he was an avid hunter who learned from his father how to survive in the wilderness.\n\nNow in his mid-forties, Lambert has found a new outlet that feeds his need for adventure, and that is taking care of the personnel, visitors and the dinosaurs themselves, maintaining order and keeping things safe. It’s a difficult task, and one that anyone who is familiar with the Jurassic World operations knows doesn’t always go according to plan. \n\nFocused and on-task when called to action, Lambert always plays it straight. He doesn’t know how to sugar-coat bad news, which means that he sometimes finds himself in awkward situations with management. But Lambert is well respected because of his abilities, and everyone knows he’s as loyal as they come.
7404	Gray Mitchell was Zach Mitchell’s younger brother. Their aunt was Claire Dearing who assigned her assistant, Zara Young, to look after them. They soon evaded her while she was speaking on the phone.\n\nGray was the more enthusiastic of the brothers for Jurassic World attractions and eagerly explored the park, although he later became upset at the prospect of their parents’ divorce. In the Gyrosphere, they took manual control and entered a forest, observing a group of Ankylosaurs.\n\nGray spotted the escaped Indominus rex, which swiftly killed the other dinosaurs before attacking the Gyrosphere. They escaped, only to be chased by the Indominus until they leapt from a cliff into a river.\n\nThe brothers found the ruins of the Jurassic Park Visitor Center, and were able to get an old Jeep running to return to the main street of Jurassic World. Reunited with their aunt, they were in one of the ACU vehicles while Owen Grady and the InGen troopers hunted the Indominus with the raptor pack.\n\nBack at the Innovation Center, Gray and Zach discovered that the lab being emptied by InGen personnel and saw Vic Hoskins killed by Delta. They fled and witnessed the final fight with the Indominus rex.
7405	Gunnar Eversoll was engaged by Eli Mills to supervise the operations at the Lockwood Estate after the rescue mission to Isla Nublar was completed. He is a sharp operator with considerable skills in auctioneering.
7406	Katashi Hamada was a team leader for InGen’s Asset Containment Unit (ACU), and led the team sent to recover the Indominus rex after its escape. They tracked the hybrid’s transponder and discovered that the Indominus had clawed it out, allowing it to ambush the team.\n\nHaving been instructed to use non-lethal weapons to subdue the beast, Hamada’s team was woefully unprepared for the battle and were quickly killed.
7407	Dr. Gerry Harding was the chief veterinarian for Jurassic Park. He was encountered by the assessment team while he was tending to a sick Triceratops. With Dr. Ellie Sattler’s assistance, they were able to identify the cause of the illness.\n\nDr. Harding took Dr. Sattler back to the Visitor Center when the park power was shut off by Dennis Nedry. He then left for the last boat leaving Isla Nublar.
7408	A brilliant, if morally ambiguous geneticist, Dr. Wu was one of the chief architects of the original Jurassic Park and the lead scientist for the team that created the first genetically resurrected dinosaurs.\n\nDr. Wu was instrumental in the process of using prehistoric DNA recovered from insects preserved in amber and combining it with modern genetic material from compatible species to bring the dinosaurs back to life.\n\nAn incredibly driven individual, Dr. Wu received a PhD from OSU before joining InGen, where he quickly rose through the ranks. Following the tragic incidents that befell the original facilities, Dr. Wu continued his association with paleo-genetics, creating multiple strains of hybrids. While almost everyone considers him a genius, there are many that also consider him dangerous.\n\nAfter Jurassic World fell to ruin, Dr. Wu escaped to work under Eli Mills at the Lockwood Estate where he was allowed to carry on his work with hybrid genomes. This work again ended in deadly disaster with the escape of the Indoraptor during an auction. Wu was left once more seeking a new home for his research when he came into contact with Lewis Dodgson.\n\nAfter years of convincing himself that his work was justified in the pursuit and service of a greater good, Dr. Wu had eventually become reduced to a shell of his former self. Decades of compromising his passion for science with corporate agendas had driven him to look back at the choices he had made, and the consequences they had brought.\n\nHowever, some hope still remained. When Dr. Wu learned of the whereabouts of Maisie Lockwood, he saw an opportunity to begin to make amends.
7409	Dr. Malcolm is a world-famous mathematician who specializes in chaos theory, a branch of physics that seeks to understand when nature defies the expected norms of linear equations and resists answers that are easily derived through mathematical models. His expertise is the study of how seemingly unconnected events can influence each other via nonlinear dynamics. \n\nSkeptical and insightful, Dr. Malcolm has witnessed the power and destruction that can result from dinosaur research and resurrection. He survived the original Jurassic Park incident, and has reluctantly been involved with InGen and its subsidiaries ever since, often acting as the voice of reason.\n\nAn iconoclastic PhD, Dr. Malcolm can at times be maddening to others, who perceive him as arrogant and condescending. More frustrating still, he is almost always right.\n\nGiving testimony and interviews about dinosaurs for years after the fall of Jurassic World, Dr. Malcolm would eventually find himself serving as the in-house philosopher at Biosyn Genetics. At the Research Compound, he gave lectures to audiences of captivated Biosyn scientists about theories from his latest book “How the World Will End”. When Dr. Ellie Sattler and Dr. Alan Grant showed up, Dr. Malcolm found himself unable to resist one last fight against the only threat greater than the dinosaurs – mankind.
7410	Iris Carroll was a long serving member of the Lockwood Estate, her work there included being a nanny for Maisie Lockwood. Although she considered herself a member of staff, her length of service meant that she was regarded more as a member of the family. Despite Maisie’s sometimes mischievous behavior hiding in the estate, Iris maintains an efficient household.
7411	The consummate showman, and consummate professional, Isaac Clement has been tasked with making the dinosaurs not only interesting, but also entertaining. \n\nIsaac has an ego to match his personality - he’s larger than life and confident at all times. Before he moved behind the scenes, Isaac was a performer on Broadway as a singer and a dancer, then moved into set design and producing.\n\nA kid from the streets that grew up in the tough parts of NYC, Isaac taught himself how to navigate difficult situations. It is a skill that has served him well during his association with Jurassic World.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Jurassic World, Isaac was drawn to the up and coming Biosyn Genetics as the spiritual successor to InGen. He saw a place where he could continue to push the envelope in an operations role at the new Research Compound.
7412	John Hammond was the creator of Jurassic Park. His company InGen developed techniques for bringing dinosaurs back to life by extracting dinosaur DNA from prehistoric insects trapped in amber. The project was ambitious but due to budget and time overruns, as well as safety concerns after a worker was killed transporting a Velociraptor, the investors sent Donald Gennaro to assess the park’s viability. To counter this, Hammond invited Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler to see the operation as well as his grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy.\n\nAfter the initial wonder at what Hammond had achieved, it became evident that all was not well. When Dennis Nedry cut the power, events took a horrific turn with Hammond powerless to protect the visitors from the dinosaurs he had created.\n\nHammond survived the 1993 Isla Nublar incident and his opinion on the park changed, having realized how dangerous it actually was.\n\nAfter four years, he was removed from controlling InGen and his position taken by Peter Ludlow, his nephew. Hammond organized a team to travel to Isla Sorna to catalogue the dinosaurs surviving there. Dr. Ian Malcolm was convinced to join the team, believing that the dinosaurs should be left in peace on the island.\n\nJohn Hammond died before the construction of Jurassic World, but his legacy was remembered by a statue placed in the Innovation Center.
7413	Dr. Dua is a respected scientist and geneticist who gained specialized knowledge in paleontology during her time at Jurassic World. Now working for the CIA's Dangerous Species Division her expertise is being used to help deal in this reality of dinosaurs and humans co-existing. \n\nIn her mid-30s and single (her work is her passion), Dr. Dua has a degree from the University of Reading, where she obtained doctorates in archeology and biology. She was scouted by the Hammond Foundation, and was quickly at the forefront of paleo research. \n\nDr. Dua can be blunt at times - she doesn’t suffer fools. But she forces herself to be social when it is required of her. She’s proud of her work and what she has been able to accomplish. And rightly so... Dr. Dua is a genius. If only she could be as good with her co-workers as she is with numbers and DNA.
7414	Karen Mitchell was Zach and Gray’s mother. She sent her sons on holiday to Jurassic World so that she could complete divorce proceedings with Scott Mitchell.\n\nDuring the 2015 incident at Jurassic World she contacted her sister, Claire Dearing, and was disappointed to learn that she wasn’t looking after the boys herself.\n\nKaren and Scott travelled to Jurassic World together just before the park was closed and were reunited with their sons the following day.
7415	Kelly Malcolm was Dr. Ian Malcolm’s twelve year old daughter, who wanted to accompany him on his expedition to Isla Sorna in 1997. He refused, knowing how dangerous it would be, but not telling her his destination.\n\nKelly stowed away in the trailer and later discovered while trying to cook dinner as a surprise, starting a fire which almost attracted the attention of the InGen hunting team.\n\nFrom the High Hide she saw the Tyrannosaurs head towards the team’s trailers, destroying them and killing Eddie Carr. She was later rescued by the hunters.\n\nKelly and her father became separated from the hunters and so avoided their fate with the raptor pack in the long grass. After reaching the abandoned workers’ village, they were able to call for help, but were cornered by Velociraptors. Kelly used her gymnastic talent to kick a raptor out of her way.\n\nThe survivors were rescued by helicopter and returned to San Diego.
7416	Ken Wheatley was the mercenary hired by Eli Mills to rescue the dinosaurs from Isla Nublar. He was a capable leader and ruthless when needed to achieve his goals.
7417	Lewis Dodgson was Dennis Nedry’s contact for selling the dinosaur embryos. He gave Nedry half of the agreed sum, $750,000, with the rest to be paid on completion.\n\nTo transport the embryos, Dodgson provided Nedry with a refrigerated device hidden within a can of shaving cream.\n\nNearly three decades later, Dodgson was in charge of Biosyn Genetics. The company was the global leader in genetic research and working to establish the new paleo-economy. Publically, Biosyn presented to the world an eco-friendly corporation, focused on using progress in dinosaur genetics as a tool for good. Dodgson worked hard to build the company and attract fresh talent after the collapse of InGen. This carefully managed reputation came into question once revelations began to surface about Biosyn Sanctuary and the research going on there.
7418	Lex Murphy was John Hammond’s granddaughter and older sister to Tim. The siblings were invited to the park by their grandfather, who was looking forward to showing them the wonders of Jurassic Park.\n\nLex didn’t share her brother’s love for dinosaurs, but still appeared enthusiastic about seeing her grandfather and what he’d accomplished. She was panicked by the Tyrannosaur attack and struggled with the subsequent events of the 1993 Isla Nublar incident.\n\nLex was an accomplished computer programmer and hacker. During the power shutdown, she was able to restore the computer systems sufficiently to raise help and lock the doors for safety.
7419	Lily grew up in the small estate of Cliffe Woods in South East England. Here, she learned to love history and also the sea and all of its diverse wildlife.\n\nHaving recently graduated from the University of Kent Business School, Lily interned with the InGen and got her first experience working with dinosaurs just before all of the chaos around Jurassic Park exploded.\n\nLily has continued to be associated with paleo curation, moving quickly up the ranks with her combination of intellect and go-getter attitude. She is very personable when dealing with the staff that cares for the animals. 
7420	Lowery Cruthers worked in the control room for Jurassic World and was present during the 2015 incident. He had a lifelong passion for dinosaurs and an interest in the original park. He even wore a Jurassic Park T-shirt into work which Claire Dearing found to be in poor taste.\n\nThe team were evacuated during the incident, but Lowery elected to remain in the control room. As his colleague Vivian Krill left he made to kiss her, but was rebuffed.\n\nDuring the final showdown with the Indominus rex, he was instructed by Dearing to open the Tyrannosaur paddock so she could lure the T. rex to fight the I. rex.
7421	Maisie Lockwood was the spirited nine year old granddaughter of Benjamin Lockwood and had spent most of her life secluded in the Lockwood Estate. She loved to create tales about dinosaurs, many inspired by the relics seen in the estate related to the history of dinosaurs. She would often hide from Iris Carroll, her nanny. Her curious nature led her to discover a conspiracy happening underneath her own home. She compassionately decided to free the dinosaurs captured in the basement of Lockwood Manor and set off the new era for dinosaurs in the modern world.\n\nAfter the incident and with the loss of her grandfather, Maisie Lockwood would become the “unofficially adopted” daughter of Owen Grady and Claire Dearing, living with them at Grady’s ranch in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Though she was kept isolated for her own safety, she wished to leave and learn more about who she was, and where she came from. It was this rebellious nature that led to Maisie being caught at the center of a desperate and dangerous chase across the globe.
7422	Mr. DNA was a cartoon character designed to educate visitors to Jurassic Park about the science of recreating dinosaurs. He featured in a film alongside John Hammond in a viewing theatre in the Visitor Center.\n\nThe character was reimagined for Jurassic World to fulfil the same purpose for guests in the Innovation Center.
7423	M.B. Nash was the pilot for the rescue team organized by the Kirby family to find their missing son on Isla Sorna. He successfully landed on the island at an old airstrip, but they were forced to flee when Udesky and the other mercenaries encountered a Spinosaurus, damaging the plane so that it crashed into the jungle.\n\nTrapped in a tree, Nash tried to save himself by grabbing Amanda Kirby, but was taken by the Spinosaurus first and eaten. Later, the few survivors of the group searched a mound of dung from the Spinosaurus to recover the satellite phone in Nash’s possession.
7424	Nick Van Owen formed part of the team organized by John Hammond to document the dinosaurs living on Isla Sorna. As well as a respected wildlife photographer, he was also selected for his experience in conflict zones.\n\nHis purpose was later revealed to be an instruction by John Hammond to disrupt the InGen efforts to capture dinosaurs on the island for the planned San Diego Jurassic Park. With Dr. Sarah Harding’s help, Van Owen infiltrated the hunters’ camp and released the dinosaurs.\n\nVan Owen encountered and brought back the injured Tyrannosaurus rex infant, and so invited the attack of its parents on the expedition’s trailer. He narrowly escaped the Tyrannosaurs with Dr. Ian Malcolm and Dr. Harding.\n\nVan Owen had heard about Roland Tembo’s plan to hunt the Tyrannosaurs. Unlike the hunters, they managed to escape the raptor ambush in the long grass, and were the first to enter the village and call for help. The survivors were then rescued by helicopter and returned to San Diego.
7425	A former Navy SEAL, Owen Grady was recruited to be a member of the Security Division of the Jurassic World Isla Nublar park. Here, his primary task was to research the behaviors of Velociraptors. Eventually, through training and imprinting, he would come to be identified by a pack of Velociraptors as their ’alpha’, or leader.\n\nGrady has an easy-going personality, and although he can appear to never take things too seriously, when called upon, he rises to the occasion. In his mind, there is a fine line between fearless and reckless, and he doesn’t really see that the difference matters much when action must be taken.\n\nDuring the Isla Nublar incident, Grady, along with Claire Dearing, was able to help rescue many of the tourists, and then face off against the Indominus rex, utilizing his pack of raptors as allies. Grady’s favorite raptor, Blue, would ultimately survive the encounter.\n\nBlue would later come under threat from mercenaries sent by Eli Mills to the ruined Isla Nublar. Grady would again team up with Claire Dearing and others to infiltrate the secret operation at the Lockwood Estate and stop Eli Mills and his illegal dinosaur auction.\n\nFollowing the events at the Lockwood Estate, Grady returned to his ranch in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. He lived with Claire Dearing and Maisie Lockwood as a family in relative isolation from the world. Grady was determined to protect Maisie from a world that would look to exploit her, but he would soon find that in this harsh new reality he couldn’t hide forever.
7426	Paul Kirby was Amanda Kirby’s ex-husband and father to Eric Kirby, who disappeared on Isla Sorna after a parasailing accident. With his ex-wife, Paul tricked Dr. Alan Grant into acting as a sightseeing guide for any dinosaurs they saw while flying over the island. The deception was revealed when they landed on the island and other members of the group turned out to be mercenaries.\n\nWhen a Spinosaurus attacked and crashed the plane, only Paul, Amanda, Udesky, Dr. Grant and Billy Brennan escaped.\n\nAfter their ordeal, they continued to hunt for Eric. The group were separated during an attack by a pack of Velociraptors, and Paul, Amanda and Brennan were forced to hide in a tree. Reunited with Dr. Grant, they were overjoyed to see him with Eric, but the joy was short-lived when they were forced to evade the Spinosaurus again.\n\nAfter other dangerous encounters, Paul heard the familiar ringtone of the satellite phone he had lent to the mercenary Nash. They tracked the sound to a mound of Spinosaurus dung and found the phone.\n\nDuring another encounter with the Spinosaurus, Paul bravely distracted the attacking dinosaur using a crane. Eventually they reached the coast, were found by US Marines and escaped the island.
7427	Peter Ludlow was John Hammond’s nephew and became CEO of InGen some time after the events at Jurassic Park in 1993. He planned to capture dinosaurs from Isla Sorna and show them at a new facility in San Diego. To achieve this, he contracted a team of hunters led by Roland Tembo.\n\nThe plan was disrupted by Nick Van Owen and Dr. Sarah Harding’s sabotage in the hunters’ camp, allowing the dinosaurs to escape. Ludlow was one of the few who managed to escape the island and did so with an adult Tyrannosaurus rex that had been sedated by Tembo before his death. An infant T. rex was also recovered and the two dinosaurs shipped to San Diego.\n\nThe ship arrived without a crew and crashed into the dock, and the adult T. rex escaped. Dr. Ian Malcolm and Dr. Harding used the infant dinosaur to lure its parent back to the ship. Ludlow tried to recapture the infant, but the adult caught him and placed him in front of it so that the infant could make its first live kill.
7428	Ray Arnold was a gruff, no-nonsense professional who was chief engineer of the original Jurassic Park, in charge of all electrical and mechanical systems on the island. An everyman of immense talent, he was instrumental not only in the operation of the original facility, but also its design.\n\nAfter Dennis Nedry sabotaged the computer systems and collapsed the power grid, Arnold rebooted the system on orders from John Hammond. Although the computers came back online, the security and power grid did not, so he set off to reboot them on his own.\n\nThis would be Arnold’s final act, as his severed arm was later discovered by Dr. Ellie Sattler. The rest of him was never found.
7429	Dr. Robert Burke was a supposed dinosaur expert, hired by Peter Ludlow as part of the hunter team retrieving dinosaurs on Isla Sorna. His knowledge was questionable after he misidentified a Compsognathus.\n\nAfter the T. rex assault on the hunters’ camp, Burke fled with Nick Van Owen and others to a nearby waterfall. When a milk snake slithered onto his shirt, Burke panicked and put himself in range of the Tyrannosaurs, which promptly ate him.
7430	Originally a big game hunter, Robert Muldoon was recruited personally by John Hammond to become the game warden of the first Jurassic Park.\n\nA quiet and confident man, Muldoon grew up in a family of hunters. As a young man, he lived for the adventure and for his love of nature, then realized that he could turn his passion into a career. After a series of posts, Muldoon became warden of Hammond’s wildlife reserve in Kenya.\n\nAs a master hunter, Muldoon was able to get inside the mind of his prey and think as they did, anticipating their moves and predicting their actions while he tracked them. It was a skill that would serve him well during his time as warden at Jurassic Park. Following the collapse of the security system, this talent would fatally fail Muldoon when a pack of Velociraptors, working in coordination, outsmarted and ambushed him.
7431	Roland Tembo was a well-known big game hunter who operated from Mombasa in Kenya. Peter Ludlow hired him to lead a team of hunters tasked with retrieving dinosaurs from Isla Sorna to be exhibited in a new facility in San Diego. Tembo was convinced by his friend Ajay Sidhu to join the expedition. For his fee, he demanded to be allowed to hunt one of the adult Tyrannosaurs.\n\nInitially the operation went well, with a variety of dinosaurs captured. Tembo’s knowledge of dinosaurs seemed limited as he couldn’t pronounce some of the names, but he ran the team efficiently. Their success was short-lived as the dinosaurs were let loose by Nick Van Owen and Dr. Sarah Harding.\n\nHis plan to hunt a T. rex was based upon capturing the infant and using it as bait to lure its parents into a killing zone. The infant was rescued by Van Owen who also stole the bullets from Roland’s gun. When Roland encountered the T. rex, he discovered his lack of ammunition and had to tranquillize the dinosaur.\n\nThe news of Sidhu’s death grieved him and he declined another job offer from Peter Ludlow, stating that he no longer wanted to spend time in the company of death.
7432	Ron Thompson has a long history with the Hammond Foundation and InGen. He began in public relations, serving first as a guide, then worked his way up to management answering directly to John Hammond. \n\nSomething of a snake in the grass, Thompson is man who is always looking out for what’s best for him personally. Obsequious when around others more powerful than himself. And when he’s in charge, Thompson shows a kind of confident arrogance that tends to lead to problems, not for him, but for others. \n\nHandsome and in shape, Thompson considers himself something of a ladies man. He sees his work with the dinosaurs and Jurassic Park as elevating him to a kind of rock star status. \n\nBut behind the bravado, there is a man worried about his future, and the future of paleocuration. Thompson realizes that if he fails, then all of the effort of InGen and John Hammond may be for naught. Which means that he’ll never profit off of all the misery that went before. \n\nFor Thompson, that would be the greatest of tragedies.
7433	Dr. Sarah Harding was an accomplished animal behavioral scientist and the daughter of Dr. Gerry Harding. She was part of the team sent to Isla Sorna in 1997 along with Dr. Ian Malcolm, with whom she had a relationship. The team were sent by John Hammond to see how the Site B dinosaurs survived and matured after the island had been evacuated.\n\nAfter the InGen hunters arrived, Dr. Harding helped Nick Van Owen free some of the captured dinosaurs, causing considerable chaos. When Van Owen found an injured baby Tyrannosaurus, Dr. Harding bound its broken leg. The adult Tyrannosaurs arrived and she returned their baby, but they attacked anyway and she was trapped in the van with Dr. Malcolm and Van Owen.\n\nThey narrowly managed to escape, but had to join with the hunters to find a way off the island. They were retrieved by helicopter and saw that one of the T. rex adults had been captured.\n\nThe ship transporting the dinosaur arrived at San Diego and crashed into the dock. The enraged Tyrannosaur was released and rampaged through the city. Working with Dr. Malcolm, Dr. Harding retrieved the baby T. rex and used it to lure the adult back to the ship, trapping it once more.
7434	Scott Mitchell was Zach and Gray’s father. He was undergoing divorce proceedings with his wife Karen when they sent their sons to Jurassic World to be with his sister in law, Claire Dearing. Their sons were involved in the 2015 incident on Isla Nublar.\n\nScott travelled to the island with his wife and arrived during the events that closed Jurassic World. The next day he was reunited with his children.
7435	Simon Masrani was the young CEO of the Masrani Global Corporation and had a particular focus on Jurassic World. The new park evolved after his company’s acquisition of InGen which was in financial trouble from the various events at Jurassic Park and Isla Sorna.\n\nInitially Jurassic World was a success, but its revenues declined as the novelty of the dinosaurs faded. This led to a hybrid project, the Indominus rex, being approved and pushed forward under Dr. Henry Wu’s supervision. Before the Indominus was due to be shown to the public, Masrani visited the park to review progress and was impressed by the creature’s abilities.\n\nDuring the review, the Indominus escaped. Masrani didn’t want to create a panic so refused to issue a park-wide alert, and wouldn’t allow the ACU teams to use lethal force. The ACU teams were wiped out.\n\nAfter witnessing his failure to control the situation, Masrani took direct intervention by piloting his helicopter, now armed with a minigun, to hunt down the Indominus rex. Injuring the creature, it ran into the nearby aviary and released the Pteranodons, one of which flew into the helicopter and destroyed it.
7436	Tim Murphy was John Hammond’s grandson and younger brother of Lex. They arrived at Jurassic Park soon after Dr. Alan Grant and the rest of the review team, and joined them on their tour of the island. Tim recognized Dr. Grant and declared that he read the paleontologist's book. He had a deep appreciation for dinosaurs and was especially excited to be on the island.\n\nThe tour was curtailed when a storm approached the island. When Dennis Nedry cut the power, their vehicles stopped outside the Tyrannosaur paddock. Tim was the calmer of the two siblings when the T. rex attacked their car. They escaped with the help of Dr. Grant and Dr. Ian Malcolm who distracted the dinosaur with a flare.\n\nHiding overnight in a tree with Dr. Grant, they were awakened by a Brachiosaurus which Tim thought was very cool. At the Visitor Center they climbed over an electric fence used to contain the dinosaurs. Tim was hurled from the fence when the power came back on, but Dr. Grant managed to revive him with CPR.\n\nIn the Visitor Center, the children were hunted by the Velociraptor pack through the kitchen. They were able to escape and were saved by the T. rex establishing her dominance as the top predator on the island.
7437	Udesky led the mercenary team hired by Amanda and Paul Kirby to rescue their lost son, Eric, from Isla Sorna. The mercenaries were soon killed, leaving Udesky with the Kirbys, Dr. Alan Grant and Billy Brennan.\n\nThey encountered a group of Velociraptors in the hatchery building and Udesky was separated from the others while trying to escape. He attempted to fend off the raptors, but one injured him. The pack then used him as a lure to try and trap the other humans, but killed him when the deceit failed.
7438	Vic Hoskins ran part of the InGen security force, including the raptor training program conducted by Owen Grady. His interest centered on using dinosaurs for military applications. He also reminisced about how he brought up a young wolf cub, which wasn’t put down when it later attacked his wife.\n\nHoskins responded swiftly to the events in the 2015 incident. When Simon Masrani died, he seized control of operations and forced a field test with Grady’s raptor pack to help his security teams locate the escaped Indominus rex. However, the inclusion of Velociraptor DNA in the Indominus rex enabled it to communicate with the raptors and make them turn on the security teams, with only a few survivors.\n\nWith the collapse of his plan, Hoskins ordered all of the genetics research be preserved and relocated with plans to re-establish the program elsewhere. Delta, from the raptor pack, killed Hoskins after he tried to emulate control in the same way that Grady had.
7439	Vivian Krill worked alongside Lowery Cruthers in the Operations Centre for Jurassic World and was involved in the 2015 incident. Their role was to monitor events in the park and ensure suitable action was taken in response.\n\nKrill reported to Claire Dearing that when the Pachycephalosaurs butted heads, they shorted out the implants that stopped them from crossing implant boundaries. Following the Indominus rex’s escape, Krill wanted to issue a park-wide alert, but was countermanded by Simon Masrani. She remained at her post alongside Lowery when Vic Hoskins took over Jurassic World operations, but then evacuated after Hoskins’s team failed to secure the Indominus rex.
7440	Zachary Mitchell was Gray’s older brother and oldest son of Karen and Scott Mitchell. Zach was less enthused than Gray about going to Jurassic World with their aunt, Claire Dearing, but was more impressed after the Mosasaurus feeding show. The brothers were initially supervised by Zara Young, Dearing’s personal assistant, but sneaked away from her to explore the park on their own.\n\nZach and Gray became involved with the 2015 Isla Nublar incident. When they ignored the recall message on the Gyrosphere, Zach manually controlled it into the forest where they witnessed the Indominus rex attack a group of Ankylosaurs.\n\nZach demonstrated his ingenuity by repairing an original Jurassic Park Jeep, allowing them to return to the main street of the park. He stuck by Gray after reuniting with Dearing, and helped keep his brother alive during the attacks from the raptor pack and the climactic battle with the Indominus rex.
7441	Zara Young worked as Claire Dearing’s personal assistant. She was assigned to look after Dearing’s nephews when they arrived at Jurassic World. She didn’t focus on the task, allowing Gray and Zach to sneak away while she was talking on the phone near the Gentle Giants Petting Zoo. Dearing was disappointed that her assistant hadn’t managed to look after the boys correctly.\n\nZara was reunited with the boys when they returned to main street. During the following dinosaur attack, she was carried away by a Pteranodon. It flew over the Mosasaurus lagoon and lost its grip. Another seized her, but they were devoured by the Mosasaurus.
7442	Zia Rodriguez was a paleo-veterinarian who’d studied veterinary medicine at Berkeley. Her dream was to work at Jurassic World, but the events of 2015 shut down the park before she reached Isla Nublar. With the predicted eruption and demise of the remaining dinosaurs she joined the Dinosaur Protection Group as their biology expert. With Claire she shared the goals of saving the dinosaurs and teaching the public about their health.\n\nAfter assisting in the recovery of the captured dinosaurs from the Lockwood Estate, Zia continued to help Claire find and free endangered dinosaurs. When one rescue at an illegal breeding farm turned into a life-threatening incident she put an end to her missions with Claire and the DPG. She decided that there must be a better way to help the dinosaurs.
7443	The herbivore Chasmosaurus is a genus of ceratopsid dinosaur with a similar appearance to Triceratops, although it is significantly smaller than its more well-known relative. Chasmosaurus weighs around one and a half tons and spans approximately 7.5m in length and is notable for the three horns on its face and large frill on its neck.
7444	Chungkingosaurus is an herbivorous dinosaur from the stegosauria suborder and gets its name from the location of its discovery, Chongqing in Sichuan, China. At around 3m in length, Chungkingosaurus is one of the smaller Stegosauria, with distinctive spikes adorning its neck, back and tail that help it to protect itself from predators.
7445	The small theropod Coelophysis is one of the earliest dinosaurs to have walked the earth, dating back 190-225m years to the Triassic period. Its name translates to ‘hollow form’ in reference to its hollow leg bones, which allow it to reach speeds of up to 25mph thanks to its light frame. Coelophysis is a carnivore and uses its sharp teeth and talons to catch its prey.
7446	Compsognathus is one of the smallest theropods ever to have existed, at under 1m in length and weighing little over 2kg – roughly the size of a chicken. Despite its small stature Compsognathus is a carnivore, using its speed and agility to hunt down lizards, insects and even other small dinosaurs. Compsognathus’ name translates to ‘pretty jaw’, a reference to its long, narrow snout.
7447	Concussion is a form of brain injury caused by direct trauma to the head or body that make the brain move suddenly. Symptoms, including loss of brain function, dizziness and vomiting, are usually temporary.
7448	Named after the distinctive crest on the top of its head – Corythosaurus translates to ‘helmet lizard’ – this herbivorous Hadrosaurid lived around 75m years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. Corythosaurus weighed around four tons and grew up to 9m in length, making it one of the largest Hadrosaurids, with a bill-shaped snout and thousands of small teeth for chewing through tough vegetation.
7449	Crichtonsaurus is a genus of ankylosaurid that looks like its more famous relative Ankylosaurus, only much smaller – this dinosaur weighs around 500kg and is approximately 7m in length. Named after the famous author Michael Crichton, the herbivorous Crichtonsaurus is notable for the thick plates on its back and powerful club on the end of its tail that protect it from larger predators.
7450	Cryolophosaurus is one of the largest theropods of the Early Jurassic era, measuring around 7m in length and half a ton in weight. It was one of the first carnivorous dinosaurs, feeding on smaller dinosaurs and mammals. The name Cryolophosaurus, which translates to ‘frozen crested lizard’, is a reference to the striking crest on its head and the cold climate of its habitat, Antarctica.
7451	Usually caused by violent encounters, or chewing on bones or rocks, damaged teeth can be problematic for dinosaurs. The pain caused by broken teeth can lead to weight loss through a lack of appetite or inability to eat.
7452	Algae comprise of a vast range of life forms that subsist on photosynthesis. They can vary in size from single cells, to giant kelp, and can be found in most climates and environments.<br><br>Poisoning can occur from contaminated water or food and effects can include vomiting, seizures, shock and liver failure.
7453	Ammonia poisoning typically only affects aquatic animals, but the genetic makeup of engineered dinosaurs makes them susceptible to similar issues.<br><br>It can occur from contaminated water sources, but also from bad food. Its effects on dinosaur health can be quite severe including blindness, lung damage and seizures.
7454	Avian pox is a viral infection adapted to birds that can affect dinosaur health. It typically attacks the respiratory system, because its ability to survive dry, dusty environments means that it often attacks the mucous membranes.<br><br>Transmission is commonly through mosquitoes, but it can also be transferred through contaminated surfaces and dust particles.<br><br>The virus is less lethal in dinosaurs than with birds, but its effects can still be severe.
7455	Avian influenza (or 'bird flu') is a strain of the flu virus that has adapted to birds, the closest genetic ancestors to dinosaurs. It can easily cross the species barrier through mutation, and the genetic components of engineered dinosaurs make them more susceptible to the disease.<br><br>It is generally spread through close contact, or contaminated equipment, but can also be present in the dung of an affected dinosaur.<br><br>It is highly contagious and can be lethal to infected dinosaurs.
7456	Bracken is a type of fern that forms part of a herbivorous dinosaur's diet. Bracken has existed for over 55 million years.<br><br>If too much bracken is consumed, or the source is tainted in some fashion, then a dinosaur may suffer from bracken poisoning which can cause thiamine deficiency, fever and secondary infections.
7457	Campylobacter is a form of gastrointestinal bacterial infection with a range of symptoms, including inflammation and dysentery.<br><br>Contaminated food is the normal vector for infection, but it can also be caught from contact with already infected animals.
7458	Chronic stress occurs when a species experiences ongoing high levels of discomfort, and can be caused by overpopulation, an unsuitable environment or a lack of food or water.<br><br>Maintaining an animal’s comfort levels is very important, as chronic stress can cause serious behavioral issues in marine reptiles, resulting in fighting with other animals or even within their own species. In the most severe cases, it can lead to shorter lifespans.
7459	Coccidioidomycosis - also known as Valley Fever - is an infection of the lung, and is caused by exposure to Coccidioides, a fungus often found in soil and sand. Symptoms include fatigue, muscle ache, shortness of breath and fever.
7460	The common cold is a widespread viral disease affecting the respiratory system.<br><br>It can be transmitted through airborne droplets and through close contact, so can spread rapidly within herds.<br><br>It's generally non-fatal in modern animals, however dinosaur immune systems may have never encountered this threat. An outbreak could still tax the Ranger operations for a park or facility, and should be taken seriously.
7461	Cryptosporidium is a tiny parasite that can cause respiratory issues and diarrhoea in infected dinosaurs.<br><br>Although generally not lethal, it can become so in dinosaurs due to their weakened state.<br><br>The parasite is typically ingested from tainted water or foodstuffs, although it can also spread by direct contact with an infected dinosaur.
7462	E. Coli is a bacteria commonly found in the gut of animals. Most strains are harmless, but some can cause stomach upsets and even kidney failure during extreme infections.<br><br>The bacteria is usually caught from the dung of infected dinosaurs, or through contaminated food.
7463	Foot and Mouth disease is an infectious viral illness that is very easily spread via close contact. Symptoms can include fever, mouth ulcers, loss of appetite and even death in younger animals.
7464	Wounds can become infected if bacteria are allowed to grow within the exposed tissue. Without treatment the infection can quickly spread, exacerbating symptoms such as localized pain, pus and fever.
7465	Ivy poisoning can cause allergic reactions in animals when they come into contact with urushiol, a resin found in the poison ivy plant. Without treatment, the disease can lead to itching, blisters and swelling.
7466	Hyperoxalemia is a condition that results from having too many oxalates (molecules found in certain foods) in the blood and is usually caused by excessive consumption of plants containing oxalates.<br><br>This illness can lead to fatigue and kidney disease and can even be fatal - so it is important to ensure that dinosaurs always have access to appropriate nutrition within their enclosures. Tall foliage tends to contain fewer oxalates, so providing enclosures with high-level leaves can protect dinosaurs from this condition.
7467	Mycotoxins are created by fungi growing on crop plants like wheat that are used extensively in herbivore dinosaur food.<br><br>The potential effects can be life threatening and include kidney damage, stomach disturbance and immune system suppression.
7468	Rabies is a viral disease that normally only affects mammals. However, genetic weaknesses in dinosaur creation mean that it can affect dinosaurs as well.<br><br>The virus causes inflammation of the brain resulting in hallucinations, violent behavior and hydrophobia.<br><br>It can be passed on by bites from an infected animal, and combined with the increased aggression poses a significant threat to island operations.
7469	Hookworms are a type of intestinal parasite from the roundworm group. The number of worms will typically determine the symptoms for the initial infection, and these include rashes, abdominal pain and diarrhoea<br><br>Infection can spread through contaminated dung or food sources, with hygiene being the most effective preventative action.
7470	Salmonella is a bacterial agent that commonly causes food poisoning, but some strains can result in more serious symptoms including fever and dehydration.<br><br>This bacteria is normally contracted through contaminated food.
7471	Silicosis is a lung disease that can lead to shortness of breath, coughing and pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring). It is caused by breathing in silica, a mineral present in some types of rock and sand.
7472	Tapeworms are a type of flatworm that can infest the digestive tract. Their effect is usually mild, but in extreme cases can cause significant health effects.<br><br>The usual cause for tapeworm infestation is from eating spoiled meat containing tapeworm eggs or larvae. An infestation can prevent a dinosaur from eating, or gaining sufficient nutrients if it does.
7473	Ticks are an external form of parasite that feed on blood by puncturing through the animal's skin. They first evolved during the Cretaceous period, up to 145 million years ago.<br><br>Infection comes from close proximity to other infected dinosaurs, or compromised sites. While not necessarily dangerous by themselves, they can be a vector for further blood-borne disease.
7474	Dinosaurs that have suffered extreme discomfort or long-term in bad environments may suffer from Psychological Trauma and will require treatment before they can be integrated into the facility.\n\nDinosaurs showing signs of Psychological Trauma should be treated with care. It is best to prove them with an environment that makes them feel more comfortable, and removing them from public view is likely to speed up the recovery process.
7475	Tuberculosis is a disease originating from a bacterial infection. It will usually attack the lungs, but can be present elsewhere in the body.<br><br>Classic symptoms include a chronic cough, fever and rapid weight loss.<br><br>The bacteria causing tuberculosis is usually transmitted via close contact with an infected animal, and is closely linked with overcrowding and malnutrition.
7476	Deinonychus is a genus of theropod that existed around 110m years ago during the Early Cretaceous period. Its name translates to ‘terrible claw’, a reference to the long, scything talon on the second toe of its hind feet, which Deinonychus uses to defend itself from predators and attack its prey. Deinonychus is a close relative of Velociraptor and can grow up to 3m in length.
7477	Dilophosaurus is a genus of large carnivorous theropod, averaging around 3m in length and 300kg in weight. It gets its name – which translates to ‘two-crested lizard’ - from the distinctive crests that sit atop its head, which are used to attract mates for reproduction. Dilophosaurus’ slender build means it can move at high speeds, while its powerful jaw allows it to keep hold of prey as it struggles to escape. 
7478	The pterosaur Dimorphodon is notable for the size of its head, which is much bigger than found in similar pterosaurs such as Pterodactylus. Its name translates to ‘two-form tooth’, in reference to the two sets of teeth it has, while Dimorphodon is one of the smaller species of pterosaur, weighing just a few kilograms and with a wingspan of around 1.5m. 
7479	Diplodocus is one of the biggest sauropods that has ever existed, at around 12 tons in weight and 24m in length. This gentle giant is a herbivore and uses its long neck to feed from tall trees (in fact, Diplodocus’ teeth are strong enough to strip bark) as well as plants and shrubs at ground level, while its vast size discourages predators from attacking. 
7480	Dracorex – full name Dracorexis hogwartsia – is a herbivore from the pachycephalosaur family and is notable for its large horns and ridged skull. In fact, this dinosaur’s appearance gives a clue to its name; the English translation of Dracorex is ‘Dragon King’. Dracorex was approximately 3.5m in length and weighed in at over 1,300lbs, with an armored skull that protected it from predators.
7481	At around 65 tons in weight and 19m in length, the titanosaurian sauropod Dreadnoughtus – which translates to ‘fears nothing’ - is one of the largest dinosaurs that has ever lived. Despite its vast size and intimidating name Dreadnoughtus is a herbivore, using its 11m long neck to reach leaves that other dinosaurs can’t get to, while also feeding on ground-level vegetation.
7482	Dryosaurus is a genus of ornithopod dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period, around 140-155m years ago. It weighs around 80-90kg and can reach up to 5m in length, with strong legs for running at speed and a stiff tail for retaining balance – both key attributes for escaping predators. Its name translates to ‘tree lizard’, in reference to its preference for forest areas.
7483	Edmontosaurus is a genus of herbivorous hadrosaurid dinosaur notable for its distinctive bill-shaped mouth. At 9m in length and over 3 tons in weight, Edmontosaurus is one of the largest hadrosaurids – but despite its bulky frame it can run at speeds of up to 30mph, allowing it to escape from predators.
7484	The carnivorous plesiosaur Elasmosaurus is easily recognizable thanks to its extended neck, which can grow up to 10m in length – roughly double the length of the rest of its body. Elasmosaurus’ streamlined body and paddle-shaped limbs allow it to swim quickly in search of fish and small reptiles to eat, grabbing prey with its long, sharp teeth. Its name translates to ‘thin-plate reptile’, referring to the plate-like bones in its chest and pelvis.
7485	Euoplocephalus is one of the largest ankylosauridae at around 8m in length and weighing 3T, it feeds on ground-level plants with its tapered beak. It is best known for its clubbed tail, armor plates on its back and horns at the base of its head – all of which help Euoplocephalus to protect itself from predators. In fact, the name Euoplocephalus translates to ‘well-armored head’.
7486	Frostbite is a skin injury that occurs when the skin and underlying tissue freezes, with the extremities most likely to be affected. Chilblains are skin swellings that are also caused by exposure to the cold.
7487	Gallimimus is a genus of theropod from the ornithomimidae family. Although its name translates to ‘chicken mimic’, Gallimimus is the biggest of the ornithomimid dinosaurs, at around 450kg and 4m in length – the name refers to its neck vertebrae, which are similar to those of chickens. Fast, agile, intelligent and with excellent vision. Gallimimus is well adapted to evading predators and catching its own prey.
7488	Geosternbergia is named after American paleontologist George F. Sternberg, who was the first to discover then genus. It is one of the largest pterosaurs, with a wingspan of over 7m and a long, tapered beak that can grab fish out of the water or be used as a spear for catching them. Geosternbergia is notable for the distinctive crest on its head, which it used to attract mates for reproduction.
7489	At around 14 tons in weight and 15m in length, Giganotosaurus is one of the largest theropods ever to have lived – its name translates to ‘giant southern lizard’, in reference to its large frame and its South American habitat. It has a similar appearance to the infamous Tyrannosaurus rex, with rows of long, serrated teeth and a powerful jaw for tearing into its prey. 
7490	Gigantspinosaurus is a genus of herbivorous dinosaur notable for the large spines on its shoulders, which help to protect it from predators – in fact, its name translates to ‘giant-spined lizard’. It is part of the stegosaur family, weighing around 700kg and growing up to 7.7m in length with a strong jaw that helps it to chew the plants and shrubs it feeds on.
7491	Herrerasaurus is a small theropod, measuring around 4.5m in length and 200kg in weight. It is one of the earliest known dinosaurs, dating back to the Late Triassic period. With a light frame that allow it to run very quickly and large, jagged teeth that help it to latch onto prey, Herrerasaurus feeds on smaller herbivores. 
7492	Notable for its distinctive flat skull (its name translates to ‘even head’), Homalocephale is a small, herbivorous dinosaur that grows to around 2.3m in length and around 45kg in weight. This genus has excellent eyesight and long legs that help it to locate and escape predators, while its thick, flat skull and wide pelvis protect it from attack.
7493	At around 8.5m in length, Huayangosaurus resembles a smaller version of Stegosaurus, sharing the same distinctive back plates as its more renowned relative. Its name translates to ‘Huayang lizard’, in reference to the location of its discovery, the previous name of the Sichuan region of China. As well as the prominent armored plates on its back, Huayangosaurus has a spiked tail that helps it to defend itself from predators.
7494	Hypothermia is the medical term for a severe drop in body temperature. Symptoms vary from milder issues such as shivering and drowsiness to loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest and death.
7495	Ichthyosaurus is a small marine reptile, measuring around 2m in length – far smaller than other genera of ichthyosaurs, which can grow up to 25m. Its paddle-like limbs and streamlined body allow it to move at great speed through water, catching its prey in its long, thin snout. Ichthyosaurus is a piscivore, with a diet consisting mostly of fish and squid.
7496	Iguanodon is a genus of large, herbivorous ornithopod, weighing around 3.2 tons and growing up to 8m long. This dinosaur’s name translates to ‘iguana tooth’, as its teeth bear a strong resemblance to those of an iguana – broad and flat, to help them chew tough vegetation. Iguanodon’s hands feature large spikes on the thumbs, which help it to protect itself from predators. 
7497	Indominus rex is the first ‘hybrid’ genus created by combining multiple existing genera, including Deinosuchus, Giganotosaurus, Carnotaurus, Velociraptor and the infamous Tyrannosaurus rex, as well as tree frogs and snakes. As such, Indominus rex is perhaps the most fearsome dinosaur of all, boasting Giganotosaurus’ size, Velociraptor’s intelligence and speed, Tyrannosaurus rex’s power and aggression, plus further traits from tree frogs and cuttlefish that allow it to hide its thermal signature.
7498	Indoraptor is a hybrid dinosaur created from the DNA of numerous other genera including Velociraptor, Deinosuchus and the ferocious Indominus rex. Famed for its high intelligence and aggressive nature, Indoraptor is known as one of the most dangerous dinosaurs in existence, with incredible speed, strength and agility, excellent eyesight and the ability to camouflage itself ahead of ambushing its prey.
7499	As with broken claws, ingrown claws can be very painful. If a dinosaur is limping, or noticeably favors one side when walking, it may be due to an ingrown claw.
7500	Internal bleeding refers to bleeding within the body, and usually occurs following trauma - although it can also be a symptom of illnesses such as gastritis. Internal bleeding can be life-threatening if not treated immediately.
7501	The stegosaurian Kentrosaurus is an herbivorous dinosaur that can grow up to 4m in length and weigh over 700kg. Like many other stegosaurian dinosaurs, Kentrosaurus is well protected from predators, with armor plates that run the length of its back and a pair of spikes that jut out from its shoulders. It also has a long, spiked tail that helps it to fend off attackers.
7502	Lacerations occur when an animal's soft body tissue is torn - usually by a sharp object or teeth. These wounds must be treated and kept clean to avoid infection and ensure the wound heals properly. 
7503	A genus of the Pliosauridae, the notorious Liopleurodon is one of the largest marine reptiles. Its name means ‘smooth-sided teeth’, and this fearsome apex predator patrolled the oceans of the Mid-Late Jurassic period using its rows of sharp teeth and powerful jaws to prey on other giant reptiles of the period. Liopleurodon’s hunting efforts are aided by a strong sense of smell that allows it to locate its targets, while its large fins propel the reptile across seas at high speed.
7504	The pterosaur Maaradactylus has a wingspan of around 6m and is easy to recognize thanks to its unusual appearance – its jaws feature curved crests on both the upper and lower sections and contain rows of sharp teeth. Native to South America, the genus is named after the Brazilian legend Maara, a mystical woman who transformed into a monster with large teeth.
7505	Maiasaura’s name translates to ‘good mother lizard’, as it was the first dinosaur to show evidence of feeding hatchlings while they were still in the nest. Notable for having a bill rather than a snout or nose, Maiasaura was a large herbivore (growing up to 9m in length and weighing in excess of 900kg) that fed on leaves, branches, ferns and other plants.
7506	Major fractures refer to bone breaks that cause severe or long-lasting damage and require extensive treatment. Rest and recuperation are essential to the healing process, while the most serious fractures may require surgery.
7507	Majungasaurus is a carnivorous theropod from the Late Cretaceous period and grew to around 9m in length. As the apex predator of its era, it used its sharp teeth and powerful bite to tear flesh from its targets and is one of the few dinosaurs known to have eaten members of its own genera - although research has not confirmed whether this cannibalistic behavior took the form of hunting or scavenging on carcasses.
7508	Notable for its incredibly long neck, which can grow up to 11m – roughly half of the its overall length – Mamenchisaurus is one of the largest sauropods to have existed. This herbivorous dinosaur feeds on plants and leaves, swallowing vegetation whole without the need for chewing. Mamenchisaurus’ name derives from the place of its discovery, the Mamen Brook in Sichuan, China.
7509	Megalosaurus was one of the first non-flying dinosaurs ever to be discovered, and lived around 155-170m years ago. This carnivorous theropod’s name translates to ‘great lizard’, an apt description for a dinosaur that grows up to 6m in length and can weigh about 700kg. Megalosaurus’ large size, powerful jaw and serrated teeth made it the apex predator of its environment.
7510	Metriacanthosaurus is a genus of carnivorous theropod that existed during the Late Jurassic period. Named after the spines on its vertebrae – the name translates to ‘moderately-spined lizard’ – Metriacanthosaurus can grow up to eight meters in length and over a ton in weight, and preys on large herbivores. Despite its relatively large size, Metriacanthosaurus can reach speeds of up to 20mph.
7511	A minor fracture is usually caused by excessive impact or stress on the bone. Minor fractures can't be treated by a Paleo Medical Team directly, but if a dinosaur is kept in good condition they will heal on their own eventually.
7512	The carnivorous Mosasaurus is one of the largest marine reptiles in history, growing up to nearly 18m in length. Mosasaurus’ rows of sharp teeth, powerful paddle-like limbs and excellent vision make it an efficient predator, feeding on fish, cephalopods and other marine reptiles. Its name translates to ‘lizard of the Meuse River’, in reference to the location of its discovery.
7513	Named after the location of its discovery, Muttaburra in Queensland, Australia, Muttaburrasaurus is a genus of herbivorous ornithopod notable for its flat skull and blunt snout. It can grow up to 9m in length and weighs over three tons, while its strong jaws and serrated teeth allow it to tear leaves, branches and shrubs with ease. 
7514	Nasutoceratops is a genus of herbivorous dinosaur that existed in the southern United States during the Late Cretaceous period. It could grow up to 7.6m in length and over one and a half tons in weight, and the name Nasutoceratops translates to ‘large-nosed, horned-face’, a reference to the two large horns protruding from its skull similar to those of Triceratops, and its distinctive blunt snout. 
7515	Nigersaurus is one of the smallest sauropods, at around 14m in length and four tons in weight. Its name refers to the location of its discovery, Niger in Africa, and this genus is notable for its teeth – its jaws contain over 500 long, thin teeth that it uses to tear plants from the ground. These teeth are replaced more often than any other genus of dinosaur, around every two weeks. 
7516	Nodosaurus is a genus of herbivorous ankylosaurid notable for the raised armor plates that cover its back – its name translates to ‘knobbed lizard’. Adults can grow to be over 6m in length and weigh nearly four tons, consuming vast quantities of plants and shrubs every day. Its armor plates are essential for protecting Nodosaurus from predators, as its short legs and heavy frame mean that it is unable to reach high speeds to escape.
7517	The herbivorous Olorotitan is a genus of hadrosaurid with a distinctive duck-billed snout and a striking crest on top of its head, and its name – which translates to ‘titanic swan’ – is a reference to its long neck. It was one of the last dinosaurs to exist in the wild, dying out in the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period, and could grow up to 10m in length
7518	Organ trauma refers to an injury to the abdominal area, such as the spleen, liver, kidneys or bowel. Signs that an animal is suffering from organ trauma may include blood in the faeces, vomit or urine.
7519	Ouranosaurus is a large iguanodont, averaging over 8m in length and weighing around two and a half tons, and is easily recognizable thanks to the large hump on its back. This herbivorous dinosaur is native to Niger in Africa and subsists on a diet of tough vegetation, using its horned beak and flat teeth to tear off and chew plants and leaves. The name Ouranosaurus means ‘courageous monitor lizard’.
7520	Pachycephalosaurus is an herbivorous dinosaur that lived in North America during the Late Cretaceous period. The name Pachycephalosaurus translates to ‘thick-headed lizard’, in reference to the genus’ large, thick skull that experts believe was used in intra-species combat, with rival dinosaurs attacking each other when competing for territory. Growing up to 4.5m in length and weighing almost half a ton, Pachycephalosaurus is one of the largest pachycephalosaurid dinosaurs.
7521	Pachyrhinosaurus is an herbivorous dinosaur from the ceratopsid family, with strong teeth in its cheeks for breaking down tough vegetation. Its name comes from the unusual blunt shape of its snout – Pachyrhinosaurus translates to ‘thick-nosed lizard’ – while this genus is identifiable by the array of adornments on its skull, including a frill and horns. Pachyrhinosaurus can grow up to 6m in length, and weigh as much as three tons.
7522	Parasaurolophus is an herbivorous hadrosaurid native to North America, and is famed for its unique head crest, which extends out from the back of its head. This distinctive crest gave the dinosaur its name, which translates to ‘near crested lizard’. Parasaurolophus grows up to around 7.5m in length, and while it usually walks on four legs, it can rear up onto two legs if it needs to run or reach food in high places.
7523	Pentaceratops is a relative of the more famous Triceratops, and bears a strong resemblance to its cousin – although, as the name (which translates to ‘five-horned face’) suggests, it has five horns instead of three. This genus can grow up to almost 7m in length and weighs in excess of five tons, and has an eye-catching frill protruding from the back of its skull that helps it to attract a mate.
7524	Known for its powerful paddle-like limbs that allow it to swim through water at speed and a flexible, elongated neck that can move quickly to catch fish and other prey, Plesiosaurus is a piscivorous marine reptile that can grow up to 3.5m in length. The name Plesiosaurus means ‘near lizard’, and the genus dates back to the Early Jurassic period, around 200m years ago.
7525	Polacanthus is a genus of herbivorous ankylosaurid that lived during the Early Cretaceous period, around 125m years ago. It can grow up to around 7m in length and is covered with armor plates and protruding spikes which help it to protect itself from predators – in fact, these spikes are the basis for its name, which translates to ‘many spines’.
7526	The small theropod Proceratosaurus is a carnivorous dinosaur, and is notable for the bold crest on its snout. Its name comes from the belief, upon its discovery, that the genus was related to Ceratosaurus. However further research has found that it is in fact a cousin of Tyrannosaurus, albeit much smaller at around 4m in length. 
7527	Pteranodon is one of the largest pterosaurs ever to have existed with a wingspan stretching up to 7m, and is easily recognizable thanks to the crest on the top of its skull, which it uses for display purposes. Although its diet consists largely of fish, Pteranodon does not have teeth, chewing its prey with its beak – in fact, its name translates to ‘wing toothless’. 
7528	A relative of the fearsome apex predator Tyrannosaurus rex, Qianzhousaurus bears a resemblance to its more famous cousin, although it is significantly smaller (growing up to around eight tons and over 10m from head to tail) and has a distinctive elongated snout. Although its jaw is less powerful than larger Tyrannosaurids, its ability to run at speed makes Qianzhousaurus an efficient predator.
7529	Sauropelta is a genus of herbivorous dinosaur native to North America, and is easily recognized thanks to the large spikes that extend from its neck. Due to its large size – weighing around 1.5 tons – Sauropelta cannot run at high speeds, so it relies on being able to defend itself from predators; as well as defensive spikes that can be used to repel attackers, it has thick armor covering most of its body – lending the genus its name, which translates to ‘lizard shield’.
7530	A second-degree burn describes any burn that affects the skin beneath the epidermis. They can be extremely painful and must be treated carefully to prevent infections.
7531	The ceratopsian dinosaur Sinoceratops existed in China around 73m years ago, and is easily identifiable thanks to the large horn on its snout. This genus can grow up to 8.1m in length and weigh as much as two tons, while the eye-catching frill above its neck helps it to attract mates. The name Sinoceratops is derived from its appearance and its environment, translating to ‘Chinese horned face’.
7532	Spinosaurus is a genus of carnivorous dinosaur native to North Africa, and lived around 95m years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. Its name translates to ‘spine lizard’, in reference to the long spines on its back vertebrae that form a sail, which researchers believe helps Spinosaurus to regulate its temperature. At around 15m in length and up to four tons in weight, Spinosaurus is one of the largest meat-eating dinosaurs to have existed.
7533	This type of injury tends to be painful but not particularly dangerous, and treatment is recommended to restore a dinosaur's full range of movement. Sprains occur when the muscle is overextended and can cause soreness and swelling.
7534	Stegosaurus is one of the most famous dinosaurs ever to have existed, thanks to the distinctive upright plates and spikes that adorn its back and tail. As Stegosaurus shared its habitat with many large predators including Ceratosaurus and Allosaurus, it required a method of defending itself – the long spikes on its tail allow it to lash out at attackers, although the back plates are believed to be for display when attracting a mate.
7535	The name Struthiomimus means ‘ostrich mimic’, and was given to the genus thanks to its similarity to a modern-day ostrich, thanks to its extended neck and long hind legs – although it is significantly bigger than an ostrich, at around 4m in length and weighing up to 150kg. Struthiomimus is an herbivorous genus and feeds mainly on soft plants, as its jaw does not contain teeth.
7536	Stygimoloch is an herbivorous dinosaur from the pachycephalosaur family that lived in the western United States around 65-68m years ago. This genus can grow to over 3m in length and is easily recognizable thanks to the large bony horns on the back of its head, which it uses to defend itself from predators. Its name translates to ‘Styx devil’, a reference to the river that separates Earth and the Underworld in Greek mythology.
7537	Measuring 5.1m in length and weighing almost 2 tons, Styracosaurus is a large herbivorous dinosaur that lived in the Cretaceous period. Styracosaurus is from the ceratopsian family of dinosaurs, with a single horn protruding from its snout and a large neck frill featuring lengthy spines that give it its name, which translates into ‘Spiked Lizard’.
7538	The large carnivorous spinosaurid Suchomimus is known for its unusual appearance – although its body is similar to that of Baryonyx or Spinosaurus, its long snout bears a closer resemblance to a modern-day crocodile; in fact, the name Suchomimus translates to ‘crocodile mimic’. Suchomimus can weigh up to two and a half tons and grow up to 9.5m in length, with large claws on its hand for catching and killing fish and small animals. 
7539	Surface wounds are injuries where the skin is broken, often caused by sharp objects or scraping against a hard surface. Surface wounds usually heal quickly if treated properly, although severe wounds may require stitches.
7540	The likely symptoms depend on the nature of the object swallowed. Some items may pass through the digestive system without causing harm, while others can be a choking hazard, lead to poisoning or cause stomach pains.
7541	Swallowing a phone can be extremely dangerous for a dinosaur. Smaller dinosaurs are likely to choke on the device, while larger dinosaurs that manage to devour it fully may get heavy metal poisoning.<br><br>Once extracted, lost property should be reunited with its owner, or their next of kin.
7542	Easily recognized thanks to its unique appearance, Tapejara is a genus of Pterosaur native to Brazil with a brightly colored crest on top of its head that could grow up to a meter in length, helping it to attract mates. Its wingspan of around 4m makes it one of the smaller Pterosaurs, while the name Tapejara translates to ‘old being’.
7543	Third-degree burns affect not just the dinosaur's skin, but the underlying tissue as well. This type of burn will often leave the affected area permanently disfigured, and invariably require major surgery.
7544	Torosaurus is notable for having one of the largest skulls the world has ever seen, measuring up to 2.7m in length. Fossil remains have shown that the frill on its skull contained two large holes, lending the genus its name, which translates to ‘perforated lizard’. Torosaurus is an herbivorous dinosaur and can weigh up to six tons, requiring a huge amount of vegetation every day for sustenance.
7545	Traumatic injuries are injuries sustained during psychologically stressful events, severe enough to also cause Psychological Trauma. Dinosaurs suffering from traumatic injuries can become unstable during treatment - and if left untreated, these injuries usually lead to poor health and fatigue.\n\nIn order to prevent dangerous outbreaks during treatment, these dinosaurs should be dealt with by a handler experienced in dinosaur psychology.
7546	The herbivorous dinosaur Triceratops is one of the largest ceratopsidae, at around 9m in length and weighing 12 tons. Notable for its large frill and the three horns on its head – which give rise to its name, which translates to ‘three-horned face – Triceratops’ diet consists mainly of ground level vegetation, although their size may have enabled them to knock over larger plants and trees to feed on.
7547	Troodon is a small, meat-eating dinosaur of the Troodon genus with long, thin legs that enable it to reach high speeds when chasing prey. Its name is Greek for ‘wounding tooth’, in reference to its sharp incisors, while this theropod’s large eyes allow it to hunt in the dark. Troodon’s large brain for its size – it stands at just over three feet tall – makes it one of the most intelligent dinosaurs.
7548	The piscivorous pterosaur Tropeognathus lived in South America during the Early Cretaceous period around 110m years ago, and is one of the largest pterosaurs ever to have existed with a wingspan of over 8m. The name Tropeognathus means ‘keel jaw’, and refers to the enlarged crests on its jaw, which the dinosaur uses to retain balance when diving into water to catch fish.
7549	Notable for its distinctive duck-billed snout and striking head crest, Tsintaosaurus is an herbivorous hadrosaurid that can grow up to 10m in length and weigh in excess of three tons. Despite its relatively large size, Tsintaosaurus was capable of walking on four legs or two and could reach high speeds when fleeing from predators. Its name comes from the location of its discovery, Qingdao in China.
7550	Tylosaurus is a large marine reptile that first existed in the Western Interior Seaway that ran through the United States and Canada during the Late Cretaceous period. Tylosaurus is one of the largest mosasaurs ever to have existed, and was the apex predator of its marine environment - studies have shown that it fed on sharks, plesiosaurs and even other mosasaurs.
7551	The most famous of all dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex enjoys a fearsome reputation around the world thanks to its size, power and aggression – a status borne out by its name, which translates to ‘King of the tyrant lizards’. At around 13.5m in length and over eight tons in weight, Tyrannosaurus rex was the apex predator of its time, with the most powerful jaw known to science and rows of large, serrated teeth.
7552	Velociraptor’s reputation as one of the most terrifying dinosaurs comes not from its size – at just 4m in length it is dwarfed by many less intimidating genera – but its ferocity and intelligence. With its large, sharp teeth and sickle-shaped claws, Velociraptor is a highly efficient predator, preying upon plant-eating dinosaurs such as Protoceratops - although its relative lack of power means it is unlikely to attack large or armoured dinosaurs.

7564	Acrocanthosaurus was officially discovered in 1950 by J. Willis Stovall and Wann Langston Junior in Atoka County, Oklahoma, when the two paleontologists dug up skeleton fragments including part of a skull. In the following decades there was little consensus on how to classify Acrocanthosaurus, and at various times it was believed to be a species of Allosaurus, Spinosaurus and Megalosaurus - but it is now considered part of the Carcharodontosaurus family.
7565	Albertosaurus’ name is derived from the location of its earliest discoveries – Alberta’s Horseshoe Canyon Formation. In 1884 a partial skull was excavated by geologist Joseph B. Tyrrell, and five years later his colleague Thomas Chesmer Weston found another, although the fossils were originally classified as being part of the existing Laelaps incrassatus species. It was finally established as a new species and named in 1905, by American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn.
7566	The first official discovery of Allosaurus fossils came in 1877, when Othniel Charles Marsh found fragments of an unknown dinosaur in Colorado. At the time, the fossils were so unlike any previously found dinosaur bones that Marsh named it Allosaurus, meaning ‘different lizard’. Two years later, more fossils were unearthed by H. F. Hubbell, although the quality of the near-complete skeleton was not realized until 1908, after Cope had died. With thousands of fossils emerging in the intervening years, Allosaurus fossils are now among the most commonly discovered dinosaur bones.
7567	The discovery of Amargasaurus came in 1984, when José Bonaparte led a team in excavating a near-complete skeleton from the sedimentary rocks of La Amarga Formation. Despite numerous attempts to unearth more, Bonaparte’s discovery is the only Amargasaurus fossil on record.
7568	Ankylosaurus was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation, Montana by Barnum Brown, four years after the famous paleontologist, known as ‘Mr. Bones’, had discovered Tyrannosaur rex. The first fossils found were a collection of bones including two teeth and a skull fragment, although Brown actually unearthed numerous osteoderms in 1900, but incorrectly attributed them to Tyrannosaurus. Further Ankylosaurus fossils were found in Canada in 1910, including a complete skull.
7569	Apatosaurus was discovered in 1877, when Othniel Charles Marsh unearthed a near-complete skeleton in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado. Its name, which translates to ‘deceptive lizard’, stems from Marsh’s initial misconception that its bone structure was that of an aquatic reptile. 
7570	Remains of Archaeornithomimus have been found across Asia, with fossils found in China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. The first discovery came in 1923, when Roy Chapman Andrews unearthed the bones of a new species, originally named Ornithomimus asiaticus. The prefix ‘archae’ (‘ancient’) was added in 1972, underlining Archaeornithomimus’ status as one of the oldest known species of Ornithomimid.
7571	Attenborosaurus’ discovery is an interesting story; the first fossils were found in the United Kingdom in 1880 but were destroyed during the Second World War. Luckily, detailed plaster casts were made, allowing researchers to examine everything but the skin. Although the discovery was initially classified as another species of Plesiosaurus, analysis of the plaster casts confirmed that this was an entirely new genus. In 1993, American paleontologist Bob Bakker gave the genus its name, in honor of Attenborough’s life’s work.
7572	Baryonyx – translated to ‘heavy claw’ - was discovered in 1983 by an amateur fossil collector from the United Kingdom named William J. Walker, while surveying the clay pits of modern-day Surrey. His initial discovery consisted of a giant claw as well as some other bones, and further investigation unearthed a near-complete Baryonyx skeleton (now housed in the Natural History Museum in London).
7573	The first Brachiosaurus fossils were uncovered in 1900 in the Morrison Formation, Colorado, and credited to Elmer S. Riggs, a celebrated American paleontologist. At the time, Brachiosaurus was considered to be the biggest dinosaur ever to have existed, although larger specimens have been discovered since.
7574	Camarasaurus was discovered in Colorado in 1877 by Oramel W. Lucas, although the bones he found were purchased by Edward Drinker Cope soon after. A near-complete skeleton was unearthed in 1925 by Charles W. Gilmore, and the finding led paleontologists of the time to believe Camarasaurus was much smaller than initially assumed – however further research showed that the skeleton was from a juvenile.
7575	This genus was formally discovered in 1925 by Charles Depéret and Justin Savornin, following the excavation of two teeth at the Continental intercalaire formation in Algeria the previous year. In 1931, German paleontologist Ernst Stromer matched the teeth to a partial skull and other bones unearthed in 1914 and, though these artefacts were destroyed during World War II, further fossils have since been found that relate to the original 1914 discovery.
7576	Everything that is known about Carnotaurus comes from a single near-complete skeleton, discovered by Argentine paleontologist José Bonaparte. The fossils were unearthed in Chubut Province, Argentina in 1984, with further exploration of the area uncovering numerous skin patches from the same dinosaur.
7577	Although the exact details of its discovery are not known, the first acknowledgement of Cearadactylus as a new genus came in 1985 when fossil collectors Giuseppe Leonardi and Guido Borgomanero named the one artefact that had been found – a partial skull that was found in the Romualdo Formation, Brazil.
7578	The first discovery of Ceratosaurus came in 1883, when Marshall Parker Felch dug up a near-complete skeleton in Cañon City, Colorado – one of many dinosaurs found in the area around this time. Further Ceratosaurus remains have been found across North America, with some fossils unearthed as far away as Portugal and Tanzania.
7579	Chasmosaurus was discovered in 1898 by Canadian paleontologist Lawrence Morris Lambe, who excavated part of the dinosaur’s neck frill from Berry Creek, California. It was initially classified as a genus of Monoclonius, but later findings confirmed it was a new discovery. Further remains have been found in the intervening years, allowing experts to define new species within the Chasmosaurus genus.
7580	The first Chungkingosaurus was discovered in 1977, when a group of Chinese paleontologists excavated numerous bones including part of a skeleton, back plates and tail vertebrae. In 1983, Dong Zhiming – one of the group that unearthed the first Chungkingosaurus artefact – officially classified it as a member of the Stegosaurinae family.
7581	Coelophysis was discovered in 1881 by amateur dinosaur enthusiast David Baldwin in New Mexico, although it wasn’t officially named until it was studied by expert Edward Drinker Cope in 1889. The first fossils found were of very poor quality, and it wasn’t until 1947 that Coelophysis was fully understood, when a large number of bones were found near to the original discovery site. 
7582	This dinosaur was discovered by fossil collector Joseph Oberndorfer in around 1859 and formed part of a collection of bones he excavated in Bavaria, Germany. The discovery consisted of a near-complete skeleton and was the only known Compsognathus specimen until over a century later in 1971, when another partial skeleton was found in Nice, France.
7583	Corythosaurus was discovered in 1911 by renowned American paleontologist Barnum Brown, who unearthed a near-complete skeleton in Red Deer River, a city in Alberta, Canada. Brown – known as ‘Mr. Bones’ thanks to his stellar reputation in his field – also excavated a significant amount of skin, allowing him to understand more about the genus.
7584	The first Crichtonsaurus remains were discovered by Chinese paleontologist Dong Zhiming in 1999, when he found parts of a jawbone in the Sunjiawan Formation, Liaoning Province. Further related specimens were subsequently discovered nearby, although there is some disagreement over the exact classification of this genus.
7585	This genus was discovered in 1990 by American paleontologist William R. Hammer while on an expedition to Antarctica. Hammer unearthed a femur and a skull from a quarry, noting that the unique head crest must mean that it was a new genus – a belief that was confirmed when the find was officially classified in 1994.
7586	Barnum Brown, known colloquially as ‘Mr. Bones’, discovered the first Deinonychus fossils in 1931 while exploring the Cloverly Formation in Montana in search of Tenontosaurus remains. During the mid-1960s over a thousand more Deinonychus bones were discovered near the location of the original find, allowing researchers to gain a much better understanding of Deinonychus’ appearance and behavior.
7587	The first Dilophosaurus fossils were discovered by American paleontologist Charles L. Camp in Arizona in 1940. For many years the genus was misclassified as a Megalosaurus - it wasn’t until 1970 that fellow dinosaur expert Samuel P. Welles declared it a new genus after realizing remains that had been wrongly described as cheek bones were in fact crests – a feature that had not previously been found in a theropod.
7588	This genus was discovered by paleontologist and fossil collector Mary Anning in Dorset, on the south coast of the United Kingdom, in 1828. It was initially classified as a new species of Pterodactylus, but in 1858 Anning’s discovery, then known as Pterodactylus macronyx, was officially classified as a new genus, Dimorphodon.
7589	The first Diplodocus remains were discovered in 1877 by geologist Benjamin Franklin Mudge and paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston in Cañon City, Colorado. Many more Diplodocus fossils have since been found nearby, with artefacts unearthed across the west of the United States.
7590	This dinosaur was first discovered in South Dakota’s Hell Creek formation in 2004, when three amateur paleontologists dug up a partial skull and other small fragments of bone. The trio donated the fossils to the Children’s Museum of Indianapolis, where it was officially named following a poll of children who visited the exhibition.
7591	Dreadnoughtus was first discovered in the Cerro Fortaleza Formation, Argentina by American paleontologist Kenneth Lacovara in 2005. The fossils found form one of the most complete dinosaur skeletons ever found, and the number and weight of the bones meant that they weren’t fully unearthed until 2009.
7592	This genus was discovered in 1876 by American paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston in Wyoming, USA, although it wasn’t until 1894 that is was classified as a new genus of dinosaur. Many more Dryosaurus fossils were unearthed during the 20th Century, providing examples of the genus at various ages.
7593	The first Edmontosaurus bones were discovered in 1891, when the ‘king of collectors’ John Bell Hatcher unearthed them in the Lance Formation, Wyoming. However, the fossils were initially considered a new species of Claosaurus – it wasn’t until 1917, and the discovery of two further skeletons in Edmonton, Canada, that it was classified as a new genus.
7594	Elasmosaurus was discovered by army doctor Theophilus Hunt Turner and army scout William Comstock in 1867, while studying rock formations near their base at Fort Wallace, Kansas. The amateur pair unearthed three large fossils and passed them on to paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, who soon confirmed that it was a new genus of plesiosaur.
7595	The first Euoplocephalus fossils were discovered in Alberta, Canada in 1897, when paleontologist Lawrence Morris Lambe unearthed a partial skull and small bits of armor. Further Euoplocephalus bones were discovered throughout the 20th Century, including a tooth excavated by Lambe himself in 1902.
7596	This genus was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1964 by Polish paleobiologist Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska when she excavated a partial skeleton in the sands of the Nemegt Basin. Further exploration of the area in the next few years unearthed more Gallimimus bones, giving researchers a more rounded understanding of the genus.
7597	Sternberg extracted the first Geosternbergia fossils from the Niobrara Formation, Kansas in 1952. It was originally classified as a new species of Pteranodon, but further study let to its reclassification as a subgenus in 1971 and eventually a new genus in 2010.
7598	Giganotosaurus was discovered by amateur fossil collector Rubén D. Carolini in 1993 when he was searching for bones in Neuquén, Argentina. Carolini’s first find was a leg bone belonging to an unknown large theropod, which led to further exploration of the area – the following year, numerous related artefacts were excavated that confirmed that this was a new genus.
7599	The first Gigantspinosaurus discovery took place in Pengtang, China in 1985, when paleontologist Ouyang Hui unearthed a partial skeleton featuring a lower jaw, tail and feet, as well as some skin impressions. The bones were initially thought to be that of a Tuojiangosaurus but following the excavation of a second Gigantspinosaurus specimen from Fuquan the previous year, it was finally classified as a new genus in 2006.
7600	This genus gets its name from the man who discovered it, an Argentine goatherd named Victorino Herrera. He found the first Herrerasaurus bones in San Juan in 1959, although it was not officially classified as a new genus until 1988, when a complete skull was unearthed.
7601	Homalocephale was first classified as a new genus in 1974 by Polish paleontologists Halszka Osmólska and Teresa Maryańska, based on a small number of fossils, including a partial skull, found in Mongolia. Many paleontologists believed the bones were actually from a juvenile Prenocephale, rather than a genus in its own right.
7602	The first Huayangosaurus specimen was discovered in 1979, when a team led by Chinese paleontologist Dong Zhiming unearthed the remains of twelve stegosauridae from a quarry in Zigong, Sichuan. The excavation included one specimen that could not be ascribed to an existing genus – in 1982, it was officially classified as a new genus, Huayangosaurus.
7603	Celebrated English paleontologist and fossil collector Mary Anning discovered Ichthyosaurus in 1811 along with her brother Joseph, when they uncovered a skeleton while digging for fossils in Lyme Regis, on the south coast of England. The remains were initially thought to be those of a crocodile – almost 200 years later, at the beginning of the 21st Century, advances in knowledge allowed Anning’s find to be classified as a new genus.
7604	The remains of the first Iguanodon were found in Sussex, England in 1822, when paleontologist Gideon Mantell unearthed multiple teeth from Tilgate Forest. The teeth were initially thought to belong to a crocodile, however further analysis by a series of experts including William Buckland and Samuel Stutchbury confirmed that it was a new genus of dinosaur.
7605	American geneticist Dr. Henry Wu began the development of the new genus in 2012, after Jurassic World owner Simon Masrani requested the creation of a new, exciting genus to increase ticket sales. Indominus rex’s conception has been fraught with controversy, however – the genus has proved far more intelligent than anticipated, making worldwide headlines in 2015 when it escaped its paddock and went on a rampage across the park.
7606	Following the scientific breakthrough of Indominus rex, Dr. Henry Wu engineered the creation of Indoraptor – which translates to ‘indomitable thief’ – in a laboratory at Lockwood Manor, California in 2015. Wu designed Indoraptor based on the Indominus rex genome and worked to enhance many of its characteristics to create an even more impressive dinosaur.
7607	Kentrosaurus was first discovered in 1909, when a team led by German paleontologist Werner Janensch unearthed a series of fossils in the Tendaguru Formation, Tanzania. It was officially named by Edwin Hennig in 1915, translating to ‘sharp point lizard’ in reference to the spikes on its body. 
7608	The first Liopleurodon fossil was unearthed by French paleontologist Henri Émile Sauvage in 1873, while excavating a site in Boulogne-sur-Mer. The discovery consisted of a single damaged tooth, but further fossils were found later along the coasts of France and England, enabling experts to understand more about the genus.
7609	Maaradactylus is one of the most recent dinosaur discoveries, with the first fossils unearthed in 2010, when a skull and several vertebrae were excavated from the Romualdo Formation in Ceara, Brazil. The remains were classified as a new genus four years later by Dr. Renan Bantim, although there is much more to learn about this dinosaur, as there have been no further finds since.
7610	American paleontologists Robert Makela and Jack Horner first described Maiasaura in 1979, after a range of fossils were excavated from the Two Medicine Formation, Montana the previous year. The finds consisted of an adult dinosaur along with numerous juveniles and broken eggshells, and further investigation of the area found over 200 specimens, leading to the colloquial name ‘Egg Mountain’.
7611	Named after the location of its discovery (Mahajanga, Madagascar), Majungasaurus was discovered by an army officer in 1896, when he noticed a series of fossils along the Betsiboka river. Further remains were unearthed throughout the 20th Century, offering evidence that it was a new genus – and in 1955, French paleontologist René Lavocat officially named it Majungasaurus.
7612	Mamenchisaurus was discovered in 1952, although it wasn’t formally identified until 1954 when Yang Zhongian (better known as C. C. Young) began studying the fossils that had been found on a construction site – leading to the type name Mamenchisaurus constructus.
7613	Although the first Megalosaurus remains were found in Oxfordshire, England in 1676, it was considered a type of large lizard until over a century later, as dinosaurs were not yet a well-known concept. It wasn’t until 1824 that it was formally named Megalosaurus by English geologist William Buckland, and another 18 years until paleontologist Richard Owen coined the term ‘dinosaur’.
7614	This genus was first described in 1923 by German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene, although the first fossils found – parts of a backbone and leg bones. – were initially attributed to Megalosaurus. Further research throughout the 20th Century led to it being reclassified as Altispinax, and finally Metriacanthosaurus in 1964, when English paleontologist Alick Walker declared that the bones were that of a new genus.
7615	Mosasaurus was first discovered as far back as 1764, when skull fragments were excavated from Mount Saint Peter, near the Meuse River in the Netherlands. The findings were initially classified as a type of fish, while a second, similar skull unearthed in 1780 led experts to believe it was a crocodile. It wasn’t until 1822 that it was officially classified as a new genus named Mosasaur by English paleontologist William Daniel Conybeare.
7616	Muttaburrasaurus was discovered by cattle farmer Doug Landon in 1963, when he unearthed parts of a skeleton next to the Thomson River in Muttaburra. His find was officially classified as a new genus in 1981 by Australian paleontologists Alan Bartholomai and Ralph Molnar, and further significant fossil finds have increased knowledge of the genus.
7617	Nasutoceratops is one of the most recent dinosaur discoveries, with the first fossils discovered in 2006 in the Kaiparowits Formation, Utah, when geologist Eric Karl Lund unearthed a number of bones including a partial skull and several vertebrae. The new genus was officially classified in 2013 given the generic name Nasutoceratops.
7618	The first Nigersaurus remains were unearthed by French paleontologist Philippe Taquet during an expedition to Gadoufaoua, Niger that spanned from 1965 to 1972, but the poor quality of the fossils meant that it wasn’t until the end of the 20th Century that the genus was officially recognized. 
7619	For over a century, everything we knew about Nodosaurus came from a single specimen that was unearthed from the Frontier Formation in Wyoming and first named by celebrated paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1889, However, in 2011 a team of miners made an incredible discovery in Alberta, Canada – a near-complete Nodosaurus skeleton, including armored plates and even skin, that took almost six years to fully excavate.
7620	The first Olorotitan remains were found in Amur, Russia around the turn of the millennium, when researchers uncovered a near-complete skeleton from the Udurchukan Formation – in fact, it was the most complete dinosaur specimen ever found in Russia. In 2003, it was classified as a new genus by celebrated Belgian paleontologist Pascal Godefroit.
7621	French paleontologist Philippe Taquet discovered Ouranosaurus in 1965 while investigating the Elrhaz Formation in Niger, when his team unearthed multiple iguanodont skeletons that had no previous classification. Further remains were unearthed in subsequent years, and in 1976 two of the most complete skeletons were officially described as a new genus and given the name Ouranosaurus.
7622	American geologist and fossil collector Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden discovered the first Pachycephalosaurus specimen in 1859 when he found a fragment of bone in the Lance Formation, Montana. The fossil was not originally thought to be that of a dinosaur but a reptile or armadillo, and it wasn’t until 1985 that it was formally classified as a new genus, named Pachycephalosaurus.
7623	The first Pachyrhinosaurus remains were recovered from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, Alberta in the mid-1940s, and were described by American fossil expert Charles Mortram Sternberg in 1950. The initial find consisted of two partial skulls, while further investigation of the site unearthed additional fossils in subsequent years.
7624	The first Parasaurolophus discovery came in 1920, when a team of paleontologists led by William Parks discovered a skull and an incomplete skeleton in Alberta, Canada. Another partial skull was unearthed in New Mexico the following year, and over the next 100 years many more specimens have been unearthed and attributed to Parasaurolophus.
7625	Charles Hazelius Sternberg, an American fossil collector and paleontologist, lays claim to the discovery of Pentaceratops, having unearthed multiple fossils from the Kirtland Formation, New Mexico in 1921. Exploration of the area led to further findings, and Pentaceratops was officially classified as a new genus by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1923. 
7626	Plesiosaurus was discovered by William Conybeare and Henry De la Beche in 1821, although the first complete skeleton was unearthed by renowned British paleontologist Mary Anning in 1823, while she was searching for fossils in the Lias Group, Dorset. Anning’s find was so unusual that it was initially dismissed as a fake – it was only when similar remains were found in the same location that she was believed.
7627	Polacanthus was discovered by celebrated paleontologist Reverend William D. Fox on the Isle of Wight, just off the south coast of England, in 1865. The remains consisted of numerous bones including the pelvis, multiple vertebrae and spines and a thighbone. More specimens have since been recovered from the same location, giving a much more detailed idea of Polacanthus’ appearance and behavior.
7628	The sole known Proceratosaurus fossil was discovered by F. Lewis Bradley in 1910 at the White Limestone Formation on the south coast of England, and examination of the specimen (a partial skull) led paleontologists like Arthur Smith Woodward and Friedrich von Huene to believe it was an ancestor of Ceratosaurus. It wasn’t until almost a century later that studies confirmed Proceratosaurus was a relative of the tyrannosaurs of the Late Cretaceous period.
7629	With over 1,200 known specimens, Pteranodon is one of the most well-known genera of flying reptiles. The first remains were found in 1870 by American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in Kansas, when he unearthed numerous wing bones from the Smoky Hill Chalk Member. Initially the find was classified as Pterodactylus, but the 1876 excavation of a skull with no teeth confirmed that it was a new genus.
7630	Qianzhousaurus is one of the most recent dinosaur discoveries, with the first specimen unearthed in 2010 by builders at the Nanxiong Formation in Ganzhou, China. The remains consisted of a number of vertebrae as well as multiple leg bones and a partial skull, which were sent for study by Chinese paleontologists including Junchang Lu and Laiping Yi, who named the new genus Qianzhousaurus in reference to the location of its discovery.
7631	The first Sauropelta fossils were found by Barnum Brown, an American paleontologist known as ‘Mr. Bones’, in 1930. Brown excavated a partial skeleton from the Cloverly Formation in Montana. However, it wasn’t until 1970 that the remains were officially classified as a new genus by fellow paleontologist John Ostrom, after he excavated related fossils from the same location. 
7632	Sinoceratops was the first ceratopsid to be discovered in China, when a partial skull was excavated from the Xingezhuang Formation, Shandong in 2008 – a significant find, showing that ceratopsian dinosaurs may have migrated from North America to Asia. Further specimens have been found in the same location, allowing researcher Xu Xing to name the genus Sinoceratops formally.
7633	The first Spinosaurus remains were discovered in 1912 by Austrian fossil collector Richard Markgraf, when he uncovered a partial skeleton in the Bahariya Formation, Egypt consisting of ribs, vertebrae and multiple spines that grew up to 1.65m long. Three years later, German paleontologist Ernst Stromer confirmed Markgraf’s find as a new genus
7634	Famous American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh was the first to classify Stegosaurus as a new genus in 1877, after fossils were found near to the Morrison Formation in Colorado. Marsh named the new genus Stegosaurus, which translates to ‘roof lizard’, because the back plates were initially believed to lie horizontal like roof tiles.
7635	Struthiomimus was discovered in 1901, when Canadian geologist Lawrence Lamb unearthed an incomplete skeleton near to the Red Deer River valley in Alberta. The fossils were first believed to be a new species of Ornithomimus – it wasn’t until 1917 that it was classified as its own genus by American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn.
7636	The history of Stygimoloch is somewhat controversial, with many competing views about its classification. The first Stygimoloch was discovered towards the end of the 19th Century in the Hell Creek Formation, Texas, but it wasn’t officially named until 1982, when Hans-Dieter Sues and Peter Galton formally described it as a new genus. Some experts now believe that the specimens found are in fact those of juvenile Pachycephalosaurus.
7637	Styracosaurus fossils were first discovered in 1913 by C.M. Sternberg in Alberta, Canada, on a site that is now known as the Dinosaur Park formation. Further remains, including a nearly complete skeleton, were found close to the location of the original discovery by Barnum Brown two years later.
7638	Suchomimus is a relatively new discovery in the world of dinosaurs, with the first fossil found in 1997. A team led by American paleontologist Paul Sereno unearthed numerous bones while exploring a site in Gadoufaoua, Niger, including a large claw. A year later, their find was officially classified as a new genus and given the name Suchomimus.
7639	Information regarding the history of Tapejara is limited, as only one confirmed specimen has been recovered thus far. The genus was first classified in 1989 by Alexander Kellner, and in the following years further fossils were unearthed that were initially classified as Tapejara – however, these bones were subsequently found to be new genera, named Tupandactylus.
7640	The discovery of Torosaurus occurred in 1891, when two large skulls with perforated frills were unearthed in Wyoming by the so-called ‘king of collectors’, John Bell Hatcher. The holes established it as a separate genus from Triceratops, a similar dinosaur that had been discovered two years earlier, and renowned paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh named the new genus Torosaurus.
7641	Triceratops was discovered in 1887, when George Lyman Cannon found a partial skull with two horns close to Denver, Colorado and sent the specimen to famous paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. The bones were initially considered to belong to a large bison but, two years later, Marsh realized that they belonged to a previously undiscovered genus of horned dinosaur, which he named Triceratops.
7642	Initially classed as a lizard when it was first discovered by American paleontologist Joseph Leidy in 1855, Troodon was officially reclassified as a dinosaur in 1901 by fellow prehistorian Franz Nopcsa. Leidy unearthed the first Troodon fossil – a tooth with serrated edges – at the Judith River Formation in Montana, the location of a huge number of paleontological discoveries.
7643	Tropeognathus was formally named in 1987 by German paleontologist Peter Wellnhofer, after his workplace received a pterosaur skull that had been excavated from the Romualdo Formation in Ceara, Brazil. Additional fossils have since been found near to the site of its discovery, including a near-complete skeleton in 2013 missing only the tail and parts of the back legs.
7644	Tsintaosaurus was discovered in 1950, when a range of hadrosaurid bones was uncovered in the Jingangkou Formation, Shandong. Although many of the bones were ascribed to existing genera, one partial skeleton required further analysis, so were referred to respected Chinese paleontologist C. C. Young – it wasn’t until 1958 that Young formally declared it a new genus, named Tsintaosaurus.
7645	The genus was first described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1869, based on his analysis of a partial skull found in the Niobrara Formation in Kansas. Initially, knowledge of Tylosaurus was limited due to the lack of a complete skeleton, but further remains uncovered during the 20th Century have developed a much wider understanding of the genus, with numerous species of Tylosaurus now formally recognized.
7646	American geologist Arthur Lakes lays claim to the discovery of Tyrannosaurus rex, when he unearthed multiple teeth in the Morrison Formation, Colorado. The teeth were initially believed to belong to Ornithomimus, but the subsequent discovery of a partial skeleton by Barnum Brown while investigating a site in Wyoming in 1900 was classified as Tyrannosaurus rex five years later, with Lakes’ find later attributed to the same genus.
7647	The first Velociraptor fossil was found in 1923 by Peter Kaisen, when he unearthed a complete skull and a toe claw while on an expedition to the Gobi Desert in Outer Mongolia with the American Museum of Natural History. The specimen was referred back to Henry Fairfield Osborne at the museum in New York and named Velociraptor – ‘swift plunderer’ – in reference to its speed and predatory behavior.

7654	This genus of frog tends to live in ponds, and is native to Europe and Asia. Usually bright green in color - though some species are darker green or brown - Pelophylax has black spots marking its body.
7655	The stunning Scarlet macaw, found in the Amazon rainforest, ranges in color, with specimens featuring orange, yellow, red and blue feathers. Its bright colors help to warn off predators and attract mates.
7656	Giant day geckos are usually found in the forests of Madagascar, and have a vivid green coloring, often with red markings on the face and back and a light yellow underside.
7657	Famous for its striking purple and blue feathers, the purple starling is indigenous to Africa, and is most commonly found near to the Gambia River basin that runs through the west of the continent.
7658	Found in the Sonoran Desert covering northern Mexico and the southern states of the USA, the Sonoran desert cochineal is notable for its production of a deep red acid that is often used to dye fabric.
7659	The valley garter snake is easily distinguished thanks to its unusual coloring, with three yellow stripes running the length of its body. It is most commonly found in Death Valley, California.
7660	Native to the Great Sandy Desert in Western Australia, the central bearded dragon's dusty grey coloring helps it blend into its surroundings, protecting it from predators.
7661	The northern leopard frog is native to North America, and is particularly abundant in the Champlain Valley, Vermont. It gets its name from the eye-catching yellow and green spots that cover its body.
7662	Eupsophus roseus, better known as the rosy ground frog, can be found in the Salar del Huasco salt flat in Northern Chile. Despite what its name suggests, this frog is usually a shade of reddish-brown.
7663	Forest rain frogs are native to the Limpopo river, South Africa, and can be found in a variety of colors - though they are most often orange, green or dark brown. Some subspecies excrete a poisonous chemical that causes paralysis.
7664	The snow leopard is an endangered species thanks to a combination of hunters and habitat reduction. Native to the Qilian Mountains in China, this species' eye-catching fur is white with black spots, while its eyes are usually green or grey.
7665	As you might have guessed from its name, the Alaska marmot is native to Alaska - specifically the Yukon river. Its fur ranges in color from light grey to dark brown, with the head usually darker than the body.
7666	This subspecies of reindeer is named after its habitat, the Norwegian archipelago Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean. Its coloring changes seasonally, with lighter colors in the winter when its fur is thicker.

7712	Isla Nublar. Where it all began. The tropical island is east of the Muertes Archipelago. John Hammond intended for the island to be the site of a new Tourist attraction, Jurassic Park. A mixture of rocky mountains, green cliffs and verdant greenery, the island is a great place to house dinosaurs in comfortable habitats while keeping a safe distance from civilization.
7713	Jurassic Park
7714	The original plan for Jurassic Park was not to be on an island, but in a city. It was set to be a place that was easily accessible by the public but plans were abandoned for John Hammond's grander vision of Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar.
7715	Jurassic Park: San Diego
7716	Site B, InGen's 'other' island. Dinosaurs were cloned in the facilities on the island before being transported over to Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar. One of five islands in the Muertes Archipelago, also known as the Five Deaths (Las Cinco Muertes), this tropical island still has dinosaurs roaming around many years after the island was abandoned. An InGen employee unlocked their cages when the island was evacuated giving them a chance at survival.

7718	Returning to Isla Nublar. After the San Diego incident and the public becoming aware of the inhabitants of Site B, Simon Masrani looked to capitalize on the public's interest in the dinosaurs. Jurassic World is to be built in a luscious area towards the south of the island.
7719	Jurassic World
7720	After the disaster of Jurassic World Isla Nublar was abandoned. The buildings and structures quickly fell into disrepair, partially due to the extreme weather conditions that can occur on the island. As the island became more damaged the dinosaurs gained more confidence and started to roam around freely, setting up new territories and living without the aid of humans.
7721	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
7722	Home to Sir Benjamin Lockwood, Lockwood Manor is set in Northern California. During the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the manor hosted an auction, where Eli Mills and Gunnarr Eversoll sold off the dinosaurs they'd managed to salvage from Isla Nublar before the volcano erupted. Some of the dinosaurs being temporarily housed there were able to escape into the forest around the manor.

7738	Cycads are seed plants with leaves similar to those of a fern, and can vary greatly in size, from a few centimeters to several meters tall. A vital source of food for dinosaurs from the Mesozoic era, most Cycads died out millions of years ago. There are some modern species, commonly referred to as 'living fossils' - although experts believe that there is no close relation to the pre-historic species. Cycads can live for up to a thousand years.
7739	Calamites is a large fern that narrows towards its highest point, with a bamboo-like stem and needle-shaped leaves. Closely related to the modern day plant Equisetum (better known as Horsetail), this genus first existed around 300-350m years ago during the Carboniferous period. Calamites is similar in appearance to Neocalamites, a plant from the Triassic period, and can grow to a height of 50m - making it an excellent source of nutrition for large herbivorous dinosaurs that feed above ground level.
7740	The term 'groundcover' is used to describe any plant that grows at ground level - considered to be anything below the 'shrub layer' that starts at 1.5m above ground. Fibrous groundcover plants provide much-needed vegetation for dinosaurs that are small or walk with their heads close to the ground.
7741	Notable for their fan-shaped leaves and irregular branches, the Ginkgo (also known as the Maidenhair) is one of the oldest species of tree in the world, and experts believe that dinosaurs played a major role in the dispersal of Ginkgo seeds. Ginkgo trees can grow to a height of over 50m, and date back to the Middle Jurassic period around 170m years ago. Female Ginkgos bear flowers that grow into fruit, providing sustenance for many of North America’s largest dinosaurs.
7742	Tempskya is a genus of tree fern that dates back to the Cretaceous period and can grow up to 4.5m in height. Specimens have been unearthed across the world, with remains found in Europe, South America and even Australia. The fern’s trunk is considered a ‘false stem’, as it is made up of numerous smaller stems that solidify to form what appears to be a single large stem. Although the leaves of Tempskya are not preserved, it is believed that they branched out from leaf bases on the trunk.
7743	Climbing plants such as vines usually grow from very long stems and often attach themselves to surrounding trees or other objects, in order to reach towards the sunlight without using a lot of energy. Climbers tend to grow very quickly and provide plenty of nutrition to a range of ground-feeding genera, from the tiny Dryosaurus to larger browsers like Triceratops and Ankylosaurus.
7744	Seed-bearing plants – also known as spermatophytes - were among the most common foliage during the era of the dinosaurs, sustaining the diets of herbivores worldwide when dinosaurs were the most dominant animals on the planet – not an easy achievement considering a single Brachiosaurus required up to 200kg of vegetation every day. Fossils of seed plants such as Lepidodendron date back to the Permian period, meaning they actually pre-date dinosaurs and, while they have largely been superseded by flowering plants, there are still around 200 species of seed-bearing plants in the wild today.

7753	Fossil findings have confirmed that Acrocanthosaurus lived approximately 110-125 million years ago in the Southern states of the USA, most notably Texas, Oklahoma and Wyoming. Acrocanthosaurus was the apex predator of its time, with a diet consisting of other dinosaurs including Hadrosaurus, Tenontosaurus and Sauropods.
7754	Further discoveries along the floodplains of Horseshoe Canyon have led researchers to believe that Albertosaurus lived approximately 70 million years ago, living alongside a wide array of other dinosaurs including Saurolophus, Edmontosaurus and Troodon.
7755	Allosaurus lived around 150 million years ago in the forests and floodplains of the western United States, most notably Utah and Colorado. It co-existed with many other species of dinosaur, feeding mostly on large herbivores such as Stegosaurus and Apatosaurus.
7756	Amargasaurus lived in the Early Cretaceous period around 120-130 million years ago, and existed alongside other Sauropods including Amargatitanis and Zapalasaurus, as well as Stegosaurus. It lived in groups among the woodlands and creeks of South America, migrating regularly in search of food.
7757	Ankylosaurus lived in Canada and the western United States, which had a warm, humid climate at that time, and preferred to stay close to rivers, forests and wetlands, allowing them to cool off during hotter periods. 
7758	Fossils dating back to the Late Jurassic period (approximately 150 million years ago) have been found across the western United States and parts of Europe. The location of these findings have led researchers to believe that Apatosaurus lived near rivers, and co-existed with Camarasaurus, Ceratosaurus and the feared Allosaurus.
7759	This dinosaur lived in Asia between 70 and 95 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period and preferred to live along the floodplains of rivers, where vegetation would be easy to come by. Archaeornithomimus co-existed in this period with many other dinosaurs including Gigantoraptor, Bactrosaurus and Sonidosaurus.
7760	Attenborosaurus lived approximately 190-200 million years ago during the Early Jurassic period, and roamed the warm waters just off the south coast of the United Kingdom, existing on a diet of fish and other marine life.
7761	Baryonyx lived in the Early Cretaceous period, around 125m years ago, co-existed with other dinosaurs including Polocanthus, Iguanodon and Valdosaurus in parts of northern Europe and Africa. Baryonyx’s mainly fish-based diet suggests it preferred to live close to shallow water, roaming near rivers and marshes.
7762	The location of fossils found dates Brachiosaurus to the Late Jurassic period, around 140-150m years ago, and co-existed with many other dinosaurs including the notorious Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus. While Brachiosaurus mainly lived in the western United States, remains have been found as far away as Portugal and Tanzania. 
7763	Camarasaurus lived around 140-150 million years ago, during the Late Jurassic period. The genus lived in herds and preferred dry environments – most notably the vast western plains of the United States, from Wyoming in the north to New Mexico in the south.
7764	Carcharodontosaurus lived in the hot and humid climate of North Africa, fighting for territory near rivers and lakes with other large dinosaurs including Spinosaurus. Its enormous size meant that it would hunt across vast distances in search of food, preying upon smaller dinosaurs like Ouranosaurus.
7765	Carnotaurus lived among the lakes and lagoons of South America around 70m years ago, preferring the warmth and humidity of this environment. It lived alongside various species of dinosaur as well as crocodiles and turtles, using its powerful hind legs to catch smaller prey such as Niebla antiqua.
7766	Cearadactylus lived in South America approximately 110 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous period. Its diet of fish show that it lived near to water. The females laid their eggs in tall trees and on cliffs, in order to protect them from predators.
7767	Ceratosaurus lived in North America around 150m years ago and co-existed with larger dinosaurs including Apatosaurus and the fearsome apex predator Allosaurus. As a carnivore further down the food chain, Ceratosaurus kept clear of larger dinosaurs, prowling the forests for smaller herbivores to prey upon.
7768	Chasmosaurus lived in Canada during the Late Cretaceous period, around 75m years ago, and existed alongside numerous other dinosaurs including Centrosaurus and the infamous Tyrannosaur rex. It used its powerful, durable beak to tear plants out of the ground, while its tough skin protected it from predators.
7769	Chungkingosaurus lived during the Late Jurassic period, approximately 150m years ago, across much of Asia – in particular the Chongqing and Guizhou region of China. It roamed forest areas with many larger Sauropods including Mamenchisaurus, while steering clear of predators such as Szechuanosaurus.
7770	Coelophysis fossils have been found across the world, from North America to the South of Africa and China. It co-existed with many other dinosaurs and reptiles in dry environments, feeding on small crocodiles and insects as well as scavenging on the carcasses of other dinosaurs. 
7771	Compsognathus existed during the Late Jurassic period around 150 million years ago and roamed the lagoons and beaches of Central Europe, which was comprised of many smaller islands at the time. It lived alongside numerous other dinosaurs and lizards – in fact, examination of the Bavarian skeleton’s stomach found the remains of a Bavarisaurus, a small lizard. 
7772	Corythosaurus lived in the forests of North America, co-existing with other large herbivores including Parasaurolophus and Centrosaurus. Studies have shown that these dinosaurs all had different jaw structures, suggesting that they had separate diets that allowed them to live alongside one another without competing for food. 
7773	Crichtonsaurus lived in China during the Late Cretaceous period, around 95m years ago. At a height of just over 2m, it fed on low-lying vegetation in forests and surrounding grasslands. It tended to stay away from other species of dinosaur, preferring to live in small herds.
7774	Although Antarctica is one of the coldest places on earth nowadays, during Cryolophosaurus’ existence – during the Early Jurassic period, around 170m years ago - it had a cool climate that rarely reached freezing temperatures. Cryolophosaurus lived alongside only one other known genus of dinosaur, the sauropodomorph Glacialisaurus, although other reptiles and mammals shared the environment.
7775	Deinonychus lived on the floodplains of the western states of the United States and Canada, roaming nearby forests and lagoons. It co-existed with – and preyed upon - many dinosaurs including Acrocanthosaurus and Sauropelta, and preferred to hunt alone rather than in packs.
7776	Dilophosaurus inhabited the western states of North America during the Early Jurassic period, around 190m years ago. As one of the biggest carnivores of its environment, Dilophosaurus is likely to have preyed on large herbivores – although it may also have eaten fish and small reptiles.
7777	Dimorphodon lived during the Early Jurassic period, around 190-200m years ago. It lived along the coasts of Europe and was a piscivore, roaming nearby forests to hunt for insects and small animals – although it may also have fed on carrion when it couldn’t find any prey.
7778	Diplodocus lived in the Morrison Formation around 150m years ago during the Late Jurassic period and tended to live near swamps, where water was easy to come by and there was plenty of vegetation. Once fully grown it would not have had any natural predators, although juveniles may have been targeted by Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus.
7779	Dracorex lived in North America during the Late Cretaceous period approximately 65-70 million years ago, alongside other species of dinosaur including Ankylosaurus, Edmontosaurus and Pachycephalosaurus.
7780	Dreadnoughtus existed during the Cretaceous period around 75-100m years ago, living alongside other large sauropods in the forests and floodplains of Argentina. Although there were many predators in the environment during this period, Dreadnoughtus’ size means it is unlikely to have been hunted – but if it was attacked, it could use its powerful tail to defend itself.
7781	Dryosaurus lived in the Morrison Formation in the western United States, co-existing with various dinosaurs including Stegosaurus and the predators Ceratosaurus and Allosaurus along the vast floodplains of the region. It had an herbivorous diet, feeding on ground-level plants and shrubs.
7782	Edmontosaurus lived during the Late Cretaceous period around 65-75m years ago, and co-existed with dinosaurs like Triceratops, Albertosaurus and Pachycephalosaurus in the subtropical climate of Canada. It shared its environment with the apex predator Tyrannosaurus, relying on its speed and intelligence to stay safe.
7783	Elasmosaurus existed in North America during the Late Cretaceous period, around 80m years ago. It swam the Western Interior Seaway, living alongside other marine reptiles and many species of fish, cephalopods and turtles.
7784	Euoplocephalus dates back to the Late Cretaceous period, around 70-75m years ago and roamed the vast floodplains of Canada and the western states of the USA, staying close to rivers to ensure easy access to water and vegetation. It lived alongside other dinosaurs including Parasaurolophus and the fearsome apex predator Albertosaurus.
7785	The remains of Gallimimus have been found across Mongolia, with fossils dating the genus to the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 70m years ago. It lived alongside a wide variety of dinosaurs near rivers, lakes and streams, feeding on ground-level plants and shrubs.
7786	Geosternbergia dates back to the Late Cretaceous period, around 85m years ago, and lived in North America. It mainly lived near coastal regions and had a piscivorous diet, darting into the ocean to feed and steering clear of the apex predator, Tyrannosaurus rex.
7787	Giganotosaurus was the apex predator of the Late Cretaceous period approximately 90-110m years ago and lived in southern Argentina alongside many other genera of dinosaurs. It fed on large herbivores of the period including Argentinosaurus, mainly attacking juveniles due to their smaller size.
7788	Gigantspinosaurus existed during the Late Jurassic period around 160m years ago, with the fossil discovery locations suggesting that it preferred a wet environment with plenty of vegetation. It lived alongside many other dinosaurs, including its relative the stegosaur family, Chungkingosaurus.
7789	Herrerasaurus lived in Argentina around 228m years ago. As one of the earliest dinosaurs it shared its environment mostly with reptiles like Saurosuchus and Venaticosuchus, although another early dinosaur, Eoraptor, existed during the same period. Research suggests that Herrerasaurus preferred a warm, wet climate, and mainly lived in forests and on floodplains.
7790	Homalocephale lived during the Late Cretaceous period around 68-72m years ago, roaming the forested areas of Mongolia in search of vegetation at ground level. These densely wooded areas may also have helped Homalocephale to hide from larger carnivores that shared this environment.
7791	Huayangosaurus inhabited the south-west of China during the Middle Jurassic period, around 160-170m years ago. This environment featured many rivers and lakes during this period, providing plenty of vegetation for herbivores like Huayangosaurus.
7792	Ichthyosaurus lived during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic periods, around 120-220 million years ago. This genus lived in the ocean and did not venture onto land, swimming the seas of Europe and Asia – it even gave birth in water.
7793	Fossil findings show that Iguanodon lived during the Early Cretaceous period, around 110-140m years ago, inhabiting much of western Europe. It co-existed with numerous other genera of dinosaur in forests and swamps near the coastline and had to defend itself from predators including the large theropod Baryonyx.
7794	Due to its synthetic origins, experts are still learning about Indominus rex’s behavior, diet and natural habitat – it was raised in isolation so that researchers could study it. Indominus rex’s ferocity and intelligence make it the apex predator of its habitat.
7795	Created just a few years ago, there is much still to be learned about Indoraptor’s behavior. Despite showing a high level of intelligence, Indoraptor’s upbringing in laboratory conditions mean it lacks socialization - its hostile behavior and great strength mean that other dinosaurs should steer clear. 
7796	Kentrosaurus lived during the Late Jurassic period, around 150-155m years ago. It inhabited Tanzania, which had a warm climate, many small lagoons and forested areas filled with lush vegetation for the dinosaur to feed on. Apex predator Allosaurus also lived during this period, preying on stegosaurian dinosaurs like Kentrosaurus.
7797	Liopleurodon roamed the seas around 150-165 million years ago, mainly sticking to shallower waters as it could not breathe underwater. It lived alongside – and feasted upon - other aquatic reptiles including ichthyosaurs, other pliosaurs and even crocodiles. 
7798	Maaradactylus existed during the Early Cretaceous period around 110m years ago, sharing its environment with fellow pterosaur Cearadactylus. It had a piscivorous diet, darting down into the ocean to grab fish before flying to nests up on the cliffs away from predators.
7799	Maiasaura lived alongside numerous other dinosaurs including Troodon and Orodromeus during the Late Cretaceous period, around 75-80m years ago. The location of so many eggshells in close proximity suggests that Maiasaura lived in groups, while research has shown that they roamed forests which provided plenty of vegetation while hiding them from predators.
7800	This genus co-existed with many other animals on the island of Madagascar around 70-80m years ago, although as one of the last dinosaurs to exist, many of its neighbors were mammals, birds and fish. It lived along the coast, preying upon sauropods such as Rapetosaurus.
7801	Mamenchisaurus existed during the Late Jurassic period, approximately 145-155m years ago and inhabited various parts of China, sharing its environment with other herbivores including Chungkingosaurus and Omeisaurus. It tended to feed from large trees, using its long but relatively light neck to reach vegetation that other dinosaurs could not.
7802	Megalosaurus lived in the tropical climes of Europe during the Middle Jurassic period, roaming forests in search of prey. An aggressive and intelligent hunter, it preyed upon other dinosaurs including Stegosaurus and Iguanodon, although it was also a capable scavenger, feeding on carcasses when necessary.
7803	Metriacanthosaurus lived around 160m years ago on the south coast of England, using the thick forests and jungles that grew during this period to sneak up on its prey. Its diet consisted mainly of other dinosaurs as well as some marine reptiles that swam near the shores.
7804	Although the first Mosasaurus remains were found in Europe, further fossils have been found across the world, from North America to parts of Africa and even Antarctica. As the apex predator of its habitat in the Late Cretaceous period (around 65-80m years ago), it would not have been attacked by other reptiles – however researchers believe that that it may have fought within its own genus.
7805	Muttaburrasaurus lived during the Early Cretaceous period, around 100-110m years ago, travelling long distances across Australia in search of forest areas that could provide the vegetation they needed. It lived alongside many herbivores as well as the predator Australovenator, which may have preyed on Muttaburrasaurus.
7806	Fossil findings have shown that Nasutoceratops lived in North America around 75m years ago and lived near the shores of the Western Interior Seaway. It co-existed with many other dinosaurs including ankylosaurids, hadrosaurs and tyrannosaurids, as well as marine reptiles such as crocodilians and turtles, and the warm, wet climate of this period provided plenty of vegetation for Nasutoceratops to feed on.
7807	Nigersaurus existed during the Early Cretaceous period, around 100-120m years ago, and roamed parts of North and Central Africa feeding on plants and ferns at ground level. It tended to live near to rivers and forests, where water and food were plentiful.
7808	Nodosaurus lived in North America during the Late Cretaceous period, around 100-110m years ago, co-existing with several large carnivores such as Carcharodontosaurus and Spinosaurus that may have preyed on it. Nodosaurus’ teeth were not designed for chewing tough plants, so it is likely that it fed on small, soft plants.
7809	Olorotitan existed during the Late Cretaceous period, around 66m years ago, and co-existed with many species of marine reptile as well as other dinosaurs including the apex predator Tarbosaurus, a cousin of the infamous Tyrannosaurus.
7810	Ouranosaurus lived on the floodplains of Africa during the Early Cretaceous period, around 100-110m years ago, and tended to stay close to rivers where there was plenty of vegetation. A wide variety of dinosaurs co-existed during this period, including Suchomimus and Nigersaurus.
7811	This genus lived around 65-75m years ago in the western United States, co-existing with many other dinosaurs including Edmontosaurus, Triceratops and the fearsome apex predator Tyrannosaurus. It is believed that Pachycephalosaurus lived in wooded areas, feeding on soft plants, fruit and seeds.
7812	Pachyrhinosaurus first walked the earth around 75m years ago during the Late Cretaceous period, and is native to Canada. It co-existed with many other dinosaurs including Edmontosaurus and the apex predator Albertosaurus, and foraged in woodlands for food. Its diet consisted mainly of leaves, shrubs and plants.
7813	The remains of Parasaurolophus have been found across the western United States, Canada and even as far away as Asia. The genus dates back around 75m years to the Late Cretaceous period, when the climate was seasonal but warm, and lived along rivers and near floodplains and swamps, alongside other dinosaurs including Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus and Euoplocephalus. 
7814	Pentaceratops existed during the Late Cretaceous period, around 75m years ago and lived on the vast plains of the western United States, feeding mainly on plants and shrubs. It lived alongside numerous other dinosaurs including Parasaurolophus and Edmontosaurus, and is unlikely to have had any predators once fully grown due to its large size.
7815	This genus lived entirely in water (although it would surface for air) and swam vast stretches of ocean, with fossils found in Europe, Asia, North America and even Australia. Plesiosaurus’ diet consisted of fish, molluscs and other marine reptiles, which it grabbed with its strong, sharp teeth.
7816	Roaming near to the coast in England parts of Western Europe, this genus would have co-existed with many other dinosaurs during the Early Cretaceous period, including predators such as Baryonyx and Neovenator, who may have preyed upon medium-sized herbivores like Polacanthus. 
7817	Information about Proceratosaurus is limited, as only one partial specimen has ever been found. However, research has shown that it lived along the south coast of England around 165m years ago during the Middle Jurassic period. Other dinosaurs shared Proceratosaurus’ habitat, including Metriacanthosaurus
7818	Pteranodon lived around 80-85m years ago during the Late Cretaceous period, and is native to North America – particularly around the Western Interior Seaway. It lived alongside its relative Nyctosaurus and the toothed bird Ichthyornis, and built their nests high up to avoid predators. 
7819	Qianzhousaurus lived in China and other parts of Asia during the Late Cretaceous period, around 66m years ago. Research has shown that its jaws were best suited to preying on small dinosaurs and lizards, with experts suggesting that it was one of the most effective predators of its period.
7820	Sauropelta existed during the Early Cretaceous period around 95-120m years ago, roaming the wide floodplains of the western United States in search of ground-level vegetation. It lived alongside a wide variety of dinosaurs, including the predator Deinonychus.
7821	Sinoceratops roamed China during the Late Cretaceous period, gravitating towards wetlands, marshes and rivers where low-lying vegetation such as ferns and plants was more plentiful. It shared its environment with numerous dinosaurs including the predator Zhuchengtyrannus, although once fully grown it was able to defend itself from attack.
7822	Spinosaurus remains have mainly been found across northern Africa, although fossils have been unearthed as far south as Kenya. It is believed that Spinosaurus preferred a warm, humid climate, and tended to live near swamps and marshes, preying on crocodiles, fish and even pterosaurs. 
7823	Stegosaurus lived in North America during the Late Jurassic period, around 145-155m years ago, roaming the vast, dry plains in search of low-lying vegetation such as trees, ferns and plants. It co-existed with many genera, including the fearsome Allosaurus, Camarasaurus and Diplodocus.
7824	Struthiomimus dates back to the Late Cretaceous period around 75m years ago, and lived in North America alongside a range of other dinosaurs including Edmontosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus and Dracorex – not to mention the feared apex predator Tyrannosaurus. 
7825	Stygimoloch co-existed with many other dinosaurs during the Late Cretaceous period, roaming the forests and plains of North America alongside Edmontosaurus, Triceratops and Ankylosaurus, as well as the apex predator Tyrannosaurus.
7826	Experts believe that Styracosaurus lived in groups on the coastal rivers and floodplains of what is now Canada, around 70-75 million years ago. This dinosaur was one of many genera to roam the area, along with Centrosaurus, Parasaurolophus and Gorgosaurus.
7827	Suchomimus dates back to the Early Cretaceous period, around 112-121m years ago, and lived in the tropical climate of Niger, staying close to floodplains and rivers where vegetation and water were most plentiful. It shared its environment with many other genera of dinosaur, including Nigersaurus and Ouranosaurus.
7828	Tapejara existed approximately 110m years ago during the Early Cretaceous period, flying across the skies of Brazil and diving down into the water to grab fish – although some paleontologists believe it may also have fed on fruit, or even the carcasses of dead animals.
7829	Torosaurus dates back around 65-70m years to the Late Cretaceous period and lived in North America. Experts believe that the genus lived in herds and co-existed with its fellow ceratopsian Triceratops, Dracorex and Edmontosaurus, while steering clear of the apex predator, Tyrannosaurus.
7830	This genus lived in the United States approximately 66-68m years ago during the Late Cretaceous period, roaming the forests and plains where food was easy to find. Numerous dinosaurs co-existed in Triceratops’ environment, including Torosaurus, Ankylosaurus and Stygimoloch, while Triceratops needed its horns to defend itself from predators including Tyrannosaurus.
7831	Troodon first existed around 65-75 million years ago, during the Late Cretaceous period. Fossil discoveries in Northern Alaska suggest that this dinosaur may have preferred a cold climate, although teeth believed to have belonged to Troodon have been found as far south as Texas and New Mexico.
7832	Experts believe that Tropeognathus lived along the coastline of South America, nesting high out of reach of predators and plunging into the sea and nearby lakes to catch its prey. It shared its habitat with numerous other dinosaurs, including fellow pterosaur Cearadactylus.
7833	Tsintaosaurus dates back to the Late Cretaceous period approximately 71-84m years ago, and co-existed with many other dinosaurs including Sinoceratops and the large predator Zhuchengtyrannus. The dry climate in China at this time meant that Tsintaosaurus stayed close to rivers and swamps, where food and water were easier to come by. 
7834	Tylosaurus remains have been unearthed across the western United States, and research suggests it lived around 80m years ago. Its powerful tail and paddle-shaped limbs allowed it to swim quickly through the water, while its huge size and sharp teeth ensured that anything that crossed Tylosaurus’ path was potential prey.
7835	Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the western side of North America during the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 66-68m years ago. As the apex predator of this period, it fed on a wide array of prey including hadrosaurs, ankylosaurs and even large sauropods, using its excellent hearing and heightened sense of smell to hunt down targets.
7836	Velociraptor remains have only been found in the Djadochta Formation in Mongolia, suggesting that the genus lived in this area around 70-74m years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. The climate at this time was desert-like, with Velociraptor gravitating towards streams and river where prey would congregate in search of vegetation.

12508	Title
12509	Make sure you rest your Scientists, if they get Disgruntled things might go wrong.
12510	You can reduce task times by adding more Scientists to a task than you need.
12511	Monitor your dinosaurs' social status as many dinosaurs like to be with others of their kind.
12512	Some dinosaurs prefer to have plenty of space to roam and can become agitated if they feel too confined.
12513	Attracting guests to your parks is the key to earning cash.
12514	Constructing appropriate fencing for the types of dinosaurs living in the enclosure is essential. Large or powerful dinosaurs can easily break through the weaker fences.
12515	Modifying the genome of your dinosaurs can also change their traits.
12516	An operational power grid is needed for buildings to function, but beware of power outages, bad weather and sabotage efforts.
12517	If a building, fence, or power line is damaged then they can be repaired by a Ranger Team.
12518	Guests are grouped together by their interests, make sure you're not only catering to one group.
12519	Some dinosaurs like lots of cover, so plant forest in their enclosures to give them somewhere to hide.
12520	The decaying carcasses of diseased dinosaurs can be a potential source of disease if eaten by other dinosaurs and should be removed as soon as possible.
12521	Scientists have traits that can affect how good they are at their job, potentially saving time and money.
12522	Mixing the wrong species can result in dead dinosaurs – keep them separated unless you want a bloodbath!
12523	Power stations won't work unless they are connected to a path, so remember to add one!
12524	Train staff to improve their skills.
12525	You can name your dinosaur in their information panel.
12526	Gates can be manually opened for dinosaurs. Try building enclosures with multiple areas!
12527	To move a dinosaur with a Transport Team, you first need to Tranquillize it with a Capture Team.
12528	Never underestimate a dinosaur. Even the smallest dinosaur can be dangerous when angered or threatened.
12529	Staff are expensive to recruit, so think carefully before you fire one.
12530	Use the Ranger Team camera to earn some additional cash photographing your dinosaurs.
12531	Ranger Teams can manually reboot sabotaged Power Stations and Gates.
12532	Genetic modifications are a great way to change how your dinosaur looks and behaves.
12533	Building Hotels can increase the number of guests in your park by increasing Guest Comfort.
12534	The Paleo-Medical Facility and its Mobile Vet Units can help to identify and cure diseases and injuries.
12535	Add the Advanced Equipment Upgrade to the Hatchery to increase the chances of getting a larger egg batch.
12536	Use the Management Views to examine various useful overlays of your level facilities.
12537	Concentrate your guest amenities around popular Viewing Galleries, Attractions, Hotels and Monorail Stations.
12538	Improve the visibility of your dinosaurs using well-placed Viewing Galleries, Viewing Platforms, Monorails, Hotels, and Tour Rides.
12539	Park Rating is determined by a combination of your Dinosaur Rating and Facility Rating.
12540	Backup Generators are handy to have around if something happens to your Power Station.
12541	You can get 'rare finds' back from expeditions, these can be extracted and sold for extra cash.
12542	Repeater Substations allow you to distribute your power around the park without having to construct pylons.
12543	Use the map to locate any trouble in your park quickly.
12544	Transport can be used to move tranquillized dinosaurs around your park, and remove them when necessary.
12545	Space around paths is reserved to make it easy to replace them with wider paths later on.
12546	When manually controlling a Ranger Team, you can use the horn to influence dinosaurs.
12547	Use Emergency Shelters during breakouts to keep people safe from dangerous dinosaurs.
12548	Diseases can spread to nearby dinosaurs, make sure you quickly respond to the disease using the MVU to scan the dinosaur to know what to do next.
12549	Paths can become overcrowded, make sure you spread guests out by offering a wide variety of attractions and different routes to get there.

18310	Okay, I think we’re out of the woods. Well, we’re never really out of the woods. Or the jungle. What I’m saying is that trouble is behind us. So don’t turn around. Ha. Just a little humor there, to relieve the stress. Yours, not mine. I’m totally cool.
18311	I don’t want to say I owe you one, so I’m not going to. But nice job getting us through that crisis.
18312	Well, that was close, but we survived. And in battle and paleo-curation, isn’t that what matters?
18313	I feel that as the park expands, so too does our understanding of the animals. One feeds the other.
18314	This added space can only be a benefit to the dinosaurs. For us, however, it means more to watch.
18315	You are obviously doing things right if the park continues to expand. More room for the dinosaurs means the enclosures feel less like cages and more like... home.
18316	With more land, we should have more options for enclosures. And a bigger park is a more impressive park.
18317	Bigger is better, right? So now that we’re bigger, we should really be packing those animals in.
18318	The park continues to grow on your watch. That’s good work. Keep at it.
18319	To us, a desert is a wasteland. Devoid of anything but the most extreme examples of life. But creatures once thrived in these lands hundreds of millions of years ago.
18320	Given the geological history that we’re dealing with, dinosaurs walking among the tumbleweeds isn’t that much of a stretch.
18321	The current situation - where dinosaurs are running wild - is untenable to those in charge. Well, those that think they’re in charge. So we're left with a problem. Or an opportunity.
18322	This is where you come in. They’ve ignored my warnings before. But maybe, this time, with you it's gonna be different. I’m willing to embrace the uncertainty.
18323	Okay, I guess an introduction is in order. I’m Cabot Finch, Assistant Director of the US Department of Fish and Wildlife. I know it sounds important. Because it is. But let’s not get bogged down in labels, and titles, and organizational flowcharts. I’ll make this easy. You work for me. See? Nothing to it. You'll be working with the experts. This is Claire Dearing and Owen Grady.
18324	If you don’t know by now, I’m Cabot Finch. I work for the government. And I’m here to watch you help. You'll be working with the experts. This is Claire Dearing and Owen Grady.
18325	And yes, we have first-hand experience with the dinosaurs. I’m the former operations manager at Jurassic World. Owen and I actually helped build the park. And unfortunately, we were there to witness its destruction. And this is Owen. He works with velociraptors...
18326	You could call me a dinosaur wrangler, though officially I’m an animal behaviorist. I was just building a level of trust with them when this happens.
18327	Thing is, we don’t want a panic.
18328	Which is unfair. They should know what is happening.
18329	In time. But let’s focus on the now, okay?
18330	Okay, so we’ll need to get a few things in place ASAP. Start with a Response Facility, equipped with both a Ranger Team four-by-four…
18331	...and a Capture Team helicopter.
18332	Ah, new meat. A little carnivore humor, you know, because of the dinosaurs. So, ha. Sorry, Cabot Finch at your service. Well, sorry again, actually I’m Cabot Finch, and I may or may not be at service, depending on the situation and how it may affect me. But it’s great to have you on board. If you work out. Otherwise, we throw you to the raptors. Just kidding again. We don’t do that. Often. You'll be working with the experts. This is Claire Dearing and Owen Grady.
18333	Cabot Finch, Assistant Director of the DFW, the United States Department of Fish and Wildlife. Now, as you can imagine, we’ve seen quite a few changes recently. Especially when it comes to wildlife. That’s where you come in, and depending on the problem, I make my exit. You'll be working with the experts. This is Claire Dearing and Owen Grady.
18334	Like everything else, dinosaurs must be managed... and regulated. That’s my job at the DFW. My name is Cabot Finch, Assistant Director. Now, I know you’ve got plenty to do, because I made sure of it. You can thank me later. You'll be working with the experts. This is Claire Dearing and Owen Grady.
18335	We are making excellent progress. So let’s stay focused.  Next step, building a Backup Generator.  Then feeding the energy it creates to the Response Facility.  And, also make sure the building is connected to the path network.  It only does us good if it's operational.
18336	Considering we have a dangerous dinosaur nearby, you know, er doubly so.
18337	What? We’re not ready.
18338	That hasn’t stopped us before.
18339	Yeah, and look at the results.
18340	Well then, I guess we’d better get on it.
18341	Hey Claire, we may have trouble tracking this dinosaur from the ground. And even more trouble if we’re lucky enough to find it.
18342	Then the sensible thing is to take a Capture Team helicopter.  You can tranq it from the air.
18343	See... I like the way I think.
18344	Hmmmm...
18345	Claire, this is Owen.
18346	I copy you.
18347	We have it.  Capture successful.
18348	I knew you’d do it.  Never had a doubt.
18349	Really?
18350	Well, maybe one or two.
18351	Well, it's better than usual. I’ll take it. Now, where do we take this dinosaur?
18352	We have the enclosure, we just need you to deliver.
18353	Don’t I always? Wait… er, you don’t have to answer that.
18354	Wasn’t going to.
18355	Okay, drop a flare where you want the delivery... it’s gonna be special.
18356	I instantly recognize this dinosaur... kinda hard to forget once you’ve been trapped in a room with one. We couldn't save that Baryonyx, but we can certainly help this one.
18357	I’m not just in awe of the science that brought the dinosaurs back, but how nature has allowed them to thrive now that they are on their own. Instinct that has survived millions of years... and is now, once again, leaving its long-lost footprints on the earth. That is wonderful. Amazing. And terrifying.
18358	John Hammond was concerned about what would happen if dinosaurs lived in the wild. It adds a whole new level of challenge. And perhaps, opportunity.
18359	I wonder... once an animal has tasted freedom, will it ever be content in captivity... no matter how nice the cage?
18360	There’s not a lot of natural vegetation, or wildlife, for the dinosaur to consume. We’ll need a feeder inside the perimeter of that enclosure.
18361	There’s not a lot out there for the dinosaur to consume, so we’ll need a feeder inside the perimeter of that enclosure.
18362	Hungry dinosaurs make me nervous.
18363	Can't disagree with you there.
18364	Good to go on this end.
18365	Copy. Okay, we need to get a full assessment of the dinosaur’s health. Utilize a Ranger Team vehicle. Owen will help you get a status of the animals’ overall welfare. Then we can plan our next move.
18366	Do we really need that? A plan? I mean, I’ve always been more of a “just make it up as I go” kinda guy.
18367	Tell you what. If this doesn’t work, we’ll try your way.
18368	Hmm, that sorta sounds like a plan…
18369	While we can’t replicate what we had on the islands, we still have to do what we can to get the dinosaurs more comfortable with their current surroundings here in Arizona.
18370	Sunscreen and margaritas by the pool? How’s that sound?
18371	Sunscreen and drinks by the pool? How’s that sound?
18372	Are you seriously asking, or pretend asking?
18373	Okay Claire, how about we add some preferred terrain to their pens instead. Better?
18374	We’ve got to monitor these dinosaurs more closely. That means setting up a Ranger Post inside their enclosure. It sounds crazy, I know. But this’ll work. Trust me.
18375	We have some very powerful people... allies... that would like to get a good look at our dinosaurs. Set up a Viewing Gallery, won’t you? And an Emergency Shelter, just in case watching dinosaurs becomes running from dinosaurs.
18376	Arizona was secure. The dinosaurs were safe. Finch and the DFW had what they needed to keep the bureaucrats off our backs. For now. But the future, that was something completely different.
18377	I’m getting reports of dinosaurs running freely around the facility, Claire.
18378	The reports may be accurate, but they don’t paint a complete picture of our current status.
18379	Angry dinosaurs on the loose. What am I missing?
18380	They’re not angry. They’re simply acting on instincts. The more threatened the dinosaurs feel, the more hostile they’ll become.
18381	Especially if they sense survival is at stake.
18382	But it is. Both theirs and ours.
18383	Yeah, but only we know that.
18384	For now, anyway.
18385	We’ll start by tranquilizing one of the dinosaurs from the helicopter, and then have a Transport Team bring it back to the facility.
18386	Great. Do it.
18387	Overall, I’d say our operations are improving. I’m confident we may get a handle on this yet. But I’m also concerned. Specifically about our bio-diversity. Still, for now, let’s focus on getting the dinosaurs safe and secure, as well as building some additional Viewing Galleries the DFW staff can use to monitor the animals.
18388	With so many of the animals running free, our priority has to be capturing as many of them as possible.  We can coordinate our efforts from an Expedition Centre.  Get one built and we’ll take it from there.
18389	I’ll be able to track the dinosaurs, but some help would sure be appreciated.  Claire tells me there are some candidates to recruit.  Scientists.  Hopefully you can find one as rough and tumble as I am.
18390	You seeing this, Claire?
18391	Yeah, I sure am. This is our first Live Capture opportunity.
18392	Let’s not miss it.
18393	We should assign that scientist you just hired to the task.  Agreed?
18394	Owen? You there? I think you're still muted.
18395	Oh, yeah, sorry. Good idea. What have we got to lose? You know, except a new recruit.
18396	Before the Remote Capture Teams return, we should have enclosures ready for the dinosaurs.  Think of it as welcoming them back home.
18397	Okay, who’s watching who?
18398	I’m not following you, Owen.
18399	Well, it’s just like, the dinosaurs are always watching us, so shouldn’t we be watching them?
18400	Yes we should.  Once we have the dinosaurs comfortably settled into their enclosures, we’ll need Viewing Galleries.
18401	What I’m saying.  Only you said it.
18402	Owen... Owen? We have a real problem.
18403	I’m trying, Claire. But it’s just... well, this is who I am.
18404	Not you.
18405	Ah, the dinosaurs. Tell me something I don’t know.
18406	Okay, how about this: there’s a massive sandstorm headed our way and it could wipe out the facility. Without power, the safety of the dinosaurs could be at serious risk.
18407	Okay, listen to me, Claire. We’ll figure this out. Have I ever let you down before?
18408	Actually... no.
18409	And I’m planning on keeping it that way. Everything we can do, we will do. We’ve survived worse. What’s a little sand?
18410	I gotta say, I'm feeling pretty concerned about our current situation. As much as I'd obviously love to help out, I'm a little tied up. So, who's gonna protect the dinosaurs?
18411	And our personnel...
18412	Yes, of course. I mean, that goes without saying.
18413	I’m saying it anyway.
18414	It’s just, it would be a tragedy to lose these animals again. And by tragedy I mean huge financial loss. And, obviously, an embarrassment to those in charge of the DFW.
18415	People such as you?
18416	Well, actually, exactly me. So how do we avoid that?
18417	Step one; round up the stragglers and get all of the dinosaurs back into their enclosures. Then, we’ll work on our safety ratings.
18418	This good?
18419	Yes... this is a plan I can support now and take credit for later.
18420	I wish we’d had more time to brief you, but as you know, the situation is fluid. Our Canadian friends are concerned that many of these wild animals are getting close to their border. We’d like to prevent them from crossing it.
18421	We being the CIA. My division is the DSD, Dangerous Species Division. I’m Dr. Dua. I have an extensive background in paleo research in this very field. At Jurassic World. And now... other locations I’m not at liberty to discuss. However, I have history with many of the people involved here.
18422	A poacher camp. What remains of it, anyway. Amateurs. They only succeeded in getting themselves and others killed. And making our job that much more difficult.
18423	The team is on standby and will be ready to assist you. I need your complete focus on the task at hand. This area must get back under control, before it becomes even more of an international incident.
18424	This is containable if we act quickly. But as our research, and frankly, some unfortunate interactions have made clear, these animals can be unpredictable out in the wild.
18425	The dinosaurs will do what they do. What they know.
18426	Which, unfortunately, we know all too well.
18427	All indications are this was a poaching operation that went seriously off the rails. Violently, I would add.
18428	Yeah, wherever the dinosaurs go, greed follows.
18429	There is big money in the underground markets for these animals. Especially in the kind of murky territory we find ourselves. I mean, at least InGen was answerable to somebody.
18430	Yeah, and how did that work out?
18431	We’d worked to make sure the dinosaurs would thrive in the forest. At first, I believed this was for the best.
18432	Then we realized that forest makes up about one-fifth of the total land mass in the US. And almost forty-percent of Canada is wilderness.
18433	Working together with the DFW and the CIA, we made the dinosaurs feel right at home. In the forest. I hope the powers that be know what they're doing.
18434	Because the dinosaurs definitely do...
18435	Dr. Dua, the dinosaurs are still agitated.
18436	Tranquilizing them would appear to be the best option at this point.
18437	Let's do it as safely and quickly as we can.
18438	Things are starting to come together, but you can’t do it all on your own. Or perhaps you can. Maybe right now, you are.
18439	But I’m about mitigating risk, so I’m going to assume the former rather than the latter.
18440	Oh, and also construct an Arrival Building, Control Centre, Response Facility and Power Generator.
18441	That should provide a solid foundation until the next disaster.
18442	Just as an organization has key players, *cough*, me, *cough*… it also has key facilities that it needs to run effectively. So you should get started with the construction of an Arrival building, a Control Centre, and also, a Backup Generator to supply power.
18443	Not bad if I do say so myself, and I guess I am, but we’re also gonna need a Response Facility. Your response to this directive should be to get one built. You, uh, you see what I did there, huh? Response, response... never mind, don’t respond.
18444	Claire, we need to get the dinosaurs into new holding enclosures.
18445	The ones we’ve already captured?
18446	Yup, that's right.
18447	And we’ll want them awake and as comfortable as possible.
18448	I’ve requisitioned a Ranger Team four by four so I can get around faster.
18449	They had dangerous animals here?
18450	Correct, Mr. Finch. We know where they were. But now, Mr. Grady, it’s essential, that we know where they are.
18451	If I know my dinosaurs, I’d say they headed off in this direction.
18452	And do you know your dinosaurs, Mr. Grady?
18453	Better than anyone.
18454	But these are not “your” dinosaurs, per se.
18455	Well, you're just going to have to trust me on this one.
18456	This looks promising. You know, not that I’m promising anything.
18457	We're not too far away now.
18458	Just be ready for anything, all right?
18459	I feel like we are getting close.
18460	Everything points in this direction.
18461	Say what you want about the dinosaurs, but they’re not subtle. Wherever they go, they leave a mark.
18462	Sounds like someone I know.
18463	Is it Dr. Malcolm? ‘cause that guy... he is out there. Talk about an ego.
18464	As opposed to...?
18465	Well, you know, a certain lovable animal behaviorist whose humility has a charm of its own.
18466	Ambush! Move quickly, but not too quickly. You’ll trigger their instinct to chase. Now move... move!
18467	Owen?! Owen, are you okay? What is happening?
18468	Little busy right now!
18469	Please tell me you have things under control.
18470	Do you want me to lie?
18471	If it’ll calm my anxiety, yes. I’m a bundle of raw nerves.
18472	We’re working the problem.
18473	We have a helicopter standing by, and they’ll attempt to tranquilize the animal from the air.
18474	Attempt? Attempt? We need success, Dr. Dua, before it can eat Grady and the others...
18475	No, please don’t say that. You believe in the team, right?
18476	Do you want me to lie?
18477	Owen, what’s our status?
18478	We’re close. We have everything almost under control, but the animal is injured. We’ll need to get her to a secure enclosure for observation and treatment.
18479	I’ll notify Dr. Dua.
18480	Oh me? I’m fine, thanks for asking.
18481	I’m going to need a Paleo-Medical Facility to assess the status of the dinosaur that they’re bringing in. We’ll need to do a full medical scan. I want to understand what went wrong if we’re going to avoid an event like this in the future.
18482	We’ve hired more scientists, per Dr. Dua, so we should have a better handle on the dinosaur’s medical status.
18483	Hopefully we’ll be able to figure out what went wrong.
18484	Sometimes what a problem requires is a new set of eyes. Let’s hire a few scientists with the skills to diagnose these animals. Make sure they are competent with the MVU and can perform medical scans on the dinosaurs. I’m interested to see what we can discover.
18485	We hafta knock that dino out. I’d suggest a tranquilizer, but you know, you do you.
18486	Right. Now that we have control of the dinosaur, temporarily... let’s get it transported to the Paleo-Medical Facility where we can treat its injuries.
18487	Part of the healing process is to get some rest. Preferably someplace comfortable.
18488	Always works for me. Same for the dinosaurs, I’d imagine.
18489	You imagine correctly.
18490	Not according to my ex.
18491	Hmmm... yes, moving on, then. We want to have the animal transported, and then secure and comfortable in its enclosure if you please.
18492	Did I ever tell you I have a favorite dinosaur, hm? It’s the one I’m not running away from. Because it is safely confined in its enclosure. So as long as you're doing your job, that means they’re all my favorites, haha. Keep ‘em comfortable. Oh, and visible to the guests. But, just, out of biting and clawing range.
18493	Hey, if I’ve learned anything, it’s that these animals are unpredictable. Like people. But with bigger teeth…
18494	Yeah... we should keep an eye on her.
18495	Right, right… who? Dr. Dua?
18496	Yes. She is working for the CIA, now.
18497	Well, you'll be pleased to know I’m running a little intelligence op of my own. Looking out for the both of us.
18498	You’re a lot more astute than you let on.
18499	Smarter too.
18500	The higher-ups would like to see that we’ve got this entire region back under control. So anything the scientists have determined as a dangerous species of dinosaur, well, they need to be rounded up.
18501	And the herbivores? What about them?
18502	As long as they stay away from civilization, leave them in place. They’ll survive in the wilderness without our intervention, right?
18503	Given time to adapt, yes, I’d say they will.
18504	I guess that’s something we’re all going to have to get used to... having dinosaurs out in the world.
18505	Is that you talking? Or is that the government?
18506	Claire, I am the government.
18507	This might be a temporary solution to a long-term issue, but I want to make sure our facility is running smoothly and we have high visibility and welfare for all the dinosaurs.
18508	When you say visibility, Dr. Dua, you’re not talking about the public, are you?
18509	The people that need to be watching, are watching. Decision-makers that are trying to keep this new reality from completely disrupting... normality.
18510	Since John Hammond first extracted dinosaur DNA from the blood of a prehistoric mosquito, our world has stopped being normal, Dr. Dua.
18511	Yea, some people, too.
18512	Meaning what exactly?
18513	Your new benefactor, doctor. The CIA.
18514	Science has always attracted strange bedfellows. Commerce, governments, technology, security... they’ve financed every major innovation in some way. Investors, public and private, they’ve always been central to the work being done. And we need to protect them and their interests from lawsuits.
18515	And the dinosaurs? Where do they fit in?
18516	We can do both. Take care of the dinosaurs and take care of the people taking care of the dinosaurs. Isn't that your point, Dr. Dua?
18517	Given where we find ourselves, it’s the only choice that makes sense.
18518	The only way to fly, right? Private. Away from the hubbub of the public. No prying eyes asking wordless questions I don’t feel much like answering.
18519	Now, call me crazy... you wouldn’t be the first... but we need to centralize our operations, and that’s why I’ve chosen this location. Well, okay, I didn’t choose it myself, but I was part of the process. I mean, I got the memo.
18520	The Appalachians have long been a place where people can kind of disappear. Whether on their own, or with the help of someone else. So why not the dinosaurs?
18521	Pull a few strings, grease a few palms, twist a few arms, and bang, just like that, the Department of Fish and Wildlife has a new base of operations. Now, we’ll need to hit the ground running if we’re going to have this place ready for something it hasn’t dealt with in sixty-five million years.
18522	The bare bones are established. But before the ones covered in flesh and blood arrive, we’ll need it fully-functioning. Owen and Claire are already on site. They’ll have more info for you. Dr. Dua will be coordinating your activities. And me... I’ll be managing expectations and staying an arm’s length away from the meatasauruses.
18523	Wait, arm’s length is probably not the best choice of words.
18524	This is what we’d hoped to accomplish on Isla Nublar. A place where the dinosaurs could finally thrive.
18525	Minus the volcano, obviously.
18526	That’s a pretty big minus.
18527	I think we can all be proud of what we’ve accomplished here.
18528	But?
18529	But what?
18530	I can hear it in your voice.
18531	Okay... okay. I’m just wondering what Dua is really up to. I don’t buy all her “saving the future by controlling the past” talk.
18532	Yeah. Lambert mentioned that some of the animals were being moved to an undisclosed location. He wouldn’t say... or, maybe he didn’t know, who was taking delivery, but it wasn’t the DFW.
18533	A third party?
18534	And you and I are not invited.
18535	I’ve just received a report of a rogue trio of dinosaurs. Uploading the data now.
18536	We may need some additional hands on this one. Mr. Lambert?
18537	Standing by and ready to go. Just give the word.
18538	George Lambert is an expert ranger who worked with us on the islands and is now with the DFW. He and Owen will deal with the dinosaurs while we address the facilities.
18539	There are a number of animals from your previous captures that will be coming your way soon. Delays are unacceptable.
18540	Understood. We’ll start with the construction of animal enclosures.
18541	We’ll catch ‘em. You keep ‘em.
18542	We have new arrivals that will need food and housing.
18543	I’d also suggest keeping a close eye on these dinosaurs until they settle into their surroundings.
18544	Lambert’s right. They’ve had a taste of the wild. Confinement may not sit well with them.
18545	Okay, we make no assumptions and pay attention to all the details.
18546	Good. Remember, just like us, the dinosaurs are always learning.
18547	And you need to keep that in mind as you build another dinosaur habitat. Safety first. For them, and us. Get it built, and then get the dinosaurs into the new enclosure. That about cover it, doc?
18548	Perfectly.
18549	I’m not sure I’ll ever be fully comfortable at the park, but the “lab coats” want to make sure the dinosaurs are, so that’s a job you should stay on top of.
18550	The dinosaurs seem to be taking to their new surroundings. I want to make sure they are doing more than surviving, however. We need the animals thriving.
18551	As I’m sure you understand, our research is more valuable when we have superior specimens in their optimal conditions, so I want you to get a Science Centre built and operational. This means more personnel will be needed, so build a Staff Centre as well.
18552	As I’m sure you understand, our research is more valuable when we have superior specimens in their optimal conditions, so I want you to get a Science Centre built and operational. This means more scientists will be needed, so build a Staff Centre as well.
18553	Ultimately, science is about the data we collect and analyze. Rubbish in, rubbish out. We want to avoid that at all costs. Especially when you consider the investment that has already been made in these dinosaurs. The CIA wants results, and we’re going to get them. Period. Full stop. End of story.
18554	Lambert here. We could really use an Expedition Centre. Get one built.
18555	Okay, Dr. Dua and that guy Finch must be getting pressure from above, because they want more animals rounded up. Check the Expedition map, and dispatch a Remote Capture Team to a hot spot. I’ll do what I can on my end.
18556	We’ll get one built before the Remote Capture Team returns.
18557	We’ll quarantine them if necessary, but we can’t know the status of the dinosaur until we’ve had a chance to examine it. We can mitigate our exposure, however, with a Paleo Medical Facility.
18558	That’s what I wanted to hear.
18559	Okay, the good news first: we’ve been achieving some success with our Remote Capture Teams, which means a steady supply of dinosaurs to our Control Centre. Now, that I like. Removing them from possible uncontrolled interaction with the general public is a “hundred percent win” in my book.
18560	Now to the bad news. Which I always hate getting but, honestly, kind of enjoy giving. These animals are arriving with an unknown disease, and we’ve got to get a handle on it post haste. That’s management speak for PDQ. Uh, pretty damn quick. Dr. Dua?
18561	We can diagnose this disease with scans from our Mobile Veterinary Unit. We’ll get it under control before too long.
18562	That’s good. Let's get to work.
18563	You have to understand something. Owen and I signed on to this project because we want what is best for the dinosaurs. Not for them to be exploited or engineered, hacked and spliced and... compromised.
18564	They deserve a chance at life as much as any other living creature.
18565	Honestly, perhaps even more, as the miracle of science gave them a second chance.
18566	So, do the research, find the cure, and then let’s use it. Or the dinosaurs die. Again. And, listen. That's not going to happen.
18567	Dr. Dua, this is Lambert. I’ve just received word that you’d like us to increase our capture efforts. Can you confirm?
18568	Yes. That’s correct. We need to grow this facility, which means we need more animals. It’s time to stress test our systems and make sure we’re capable of managing both the science and our operations.
18569	Understood. My teams are standing by. We still have a number of dinosaurs in the wild. Plenty of targets to bring in.
18570	Assets. And yes... this will be an ongoing mission for us moving forward.
18571	Success brings with it its own set of problems. Hey, I’m not complaining. Okay, maybe I am. A little. But before we can really call this operation world-class, we need to address some issues. Specifically, you’ve got to ensure we have High Shelter Coverage, excellent Dinosaur Visibility, and no lethal accidents, huh. Given our history, that last one is going to be the cruncher.
18572	First reports were from Seattle-Tacoma Airport’s air traffic control, but now we are getting radar hits from Portland International. So they are traveling south.
18573	Probably because of the weather.
18574	Agreed. They’re migrating.
18575	But... what happens if one of these animals decides to play chicken with a commercial airliner?
18576	This is the modern world and the prehistoric one on a collision course.
18577	Even contrived, planned, and managed beauty has its charms. But what appeals to the senses is the asymmetry of nature. Its rough edges. Its mistakes. A tree that is both out of place and exactly where it needs to be.
18578	Much like the dinosaurs.
18579	Excuse me, Dr. Malcolm. There are reports of a large herd of subject animals roaming freely in Yosemite.
18580	To my point. Chaos. Don’t you just love it?
18581	If Owen and Lambert do what they say they can, we’re going to need facilities in place for the flyers when they arrive. Let’s start with some aviary domes. And a hatchery. Oh we also need an Expedition Centre. And as you heard, time is not on our side.
18582	We’re ready on this end. We can send out expeditions for remote capture.
18583	These creatures can cover a lot of ground from the air, so we should snap to it.
18584	All right, let’s fly the not-so-friendly skies.
18585	We have captured flyers ready to deliver.
18586	Have them brought to the Aviary Hatchery by our Transport Team. We’ll then release them into the domes.
18587	And by release, you mean contain...
18588	Yes. In a controlled environment and under our supervision and care.
18589	Excellent.
18590	We should be on schedule to deliver assets to the other site.
18591	Looks like we might be getting things under control.
18592	"I would say “famous last words”, but given the number of times I could have used this very phrase over the years, I'm gonna go with “predictable"" last words instead."
18593	Dr. Malcolm? Why are you contacting us?
18594	The same thing as always. The dinosaurs. And my obsessive need to witness the car crash when it happens.
18595	It’s good to hear from you again, Dr. Malcolm.
18596	Ah, Dr. Dua. You’re now increasing the so-called “intelligence” part of the CIA, if I’m to understand correctly.
18597	We do what we can.
18598	Yes... yes. We do what we can. And sometimes more than we should. Interesting times. And I mean, times, as the dinosaurs are living in ours. Should they be here? No. Are they? Yes. Ergo, they should. And the hidden hand of chaos is revealed.
18599	It’s what else remains hidden that’s concerning me at the moment, doctor.
18600	Oh yes indeed, yes, yes. And that’s why I’ve brought someone with me to help shed some light in this regard. Mr. Isaac Clement, a specialist of the spectacular. You should be hearing from him soon.
18601	These dinosaurs require feeders if they’re to stay healthy. Stay on top of it.
18602	Hey. I’m Isaac Clement. Dr. Malcolm should have mentioned me earlier. We have some specific requirements, including a Ranger Team to gather information and monitor the animals within the aviary. A Viewing Gallery is also on our list, so now it’s on yours.
18603	Hey, Claire. I’ve been thinking...
18604	When you think, it makes me nervous.
18605	No, no, seriously. Why the flyers?
18606	Okay. I’m not following you.
18607	Dr. Malcolm starts contacting Dr. Dua from who-knows where when these flying reptiles become an issue. Why?
18608	Because... they introduce a unique danger? And he’s concerned?
18609	Yeah, that’s probably it.
18610	Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. For now, we should make sure the satisfaction levels for the flyers is high. That’s verifiable data we can use. Forget the conspiracy angle.
18611	Hello, we're chasing prehistoric animals, Claire. Reality ain’t what it used to be.
18612	You were right, Dr. Malcolm.
18613	It’s sort of my thing.
18614	The facility is functioning as anticipated.
18615	We have enough assets in the pipeline that we should be able to move forward soon.
18616	Right now, we’re putting out brushfires. But this... this is an inferno that could engulf the world.
18617	Your concern is noted.
18618	For now, I suggest we focus on this location. It’s about high welfare and visibility for the animals. And safety for the DFW staff, of course.
18619	Learning to coexist with the dinosaurs is a process. We’re getting there.
18620	And if we don’t, where does that leave us? We will have created an apocalypse born of our arrogance. Humanity vs. the dinosaurs. And, honestly, I’m not sure who deserves to win.
18621	If we want to find success, we must look to the sky. That means more flyers... and more species of flyers... in the aviaries. Flap, not flop, huh?
18622	The aviaries are quite the draw for our guests. I guess it’s like bird-watching and then some, huh? So let’s keep ‘em interested and engaged, and pump our ratings in the process. Dino Visibility - good. Shelter Coverage - high. And accidents? None that are lethal... or I can be blamed for, haha.
18623	Yosemite. Over one thousand square miles in size. It is home to one of the oldest plant species on earth, the Giant Sequoias, which have been growing in this part of California for over sixty-million years.
18624	That could be our connection. And what’s drawing the dinosaurs here.
18625	The Sequoias are familiar, part of their genetic memory.
18626	Then this land could be a perfect fit for the dinosaurs.
18627	"Yosemite. From the language of the Miwok tribe, it means ""the valley of the killers."""
18628	Fitting, isn't it?
18629	The strong prey on the weak. The hunter and the hunted constantly optimizing their size, their appearance, their strength, their vision, their speed. The mind becoming ever better at that one task necessary for survival.
18630	Evolution is a never-ending arms race that continues to this day. That's life. It embraces change.
18631	"And now dinosaurs have returned to ""the valley of the killers."" The question isn't ""do they belong in Yosemite?"" They most certainly do. No… no, the question is… ""will they stay?"""
18632	Okay, the horse is already out of the barn. That’s a saying, by the way. There’s no horse and no barn.
18633	What Owen means is that things are already in motion. We have dinosaurs that we’ll need to capture and facilities that need to be built.
18634	But not actual barns. Barns no. Expedition Centre, a Paleo-Medical Facility, and a Response Facility, yes.
18635	Those should give us a solid foundation.
18636	How are you at photography?
18637	Um... in what aspect?  I think my right side is a little better than my left.
18638	Owen, I’m talking about the dinosaurs.  We’re gonna want images of the species in Yosemite.  And you’re wrong about the “right.”
18639	Okay, I get it now. We can take out one of the vehicles and go on a photo expedition. And yeah, I know, my left is better.
18640	You’re still here.
18641	I’m leaving... but I haven’t left.  Get it?  I’m doing a play on...
18642	Go.
18643	Gone, gone I’m gone.
18644	It’s amazing to see these animals in something like their natural habitats.
18645	These photographs are like we’re not just capturing the dinosaurs, but a moment in time.  Which considering how they got here, feels doubly weird.
18646	I think this is as close as we’ll ever get to seeing the dinosaurs the way they way were sixty-five million years ago.   And it’s... breathtaking.
18647	We need our Remote Capture Teams bringing back the most dangerous dinosaurs.  The safety of the public and the dinosaurs are both at stake.
18648	I’m your man. And, uh, and I’m your man.
18649	I know.  Once we have them, we’ll get them secured within our new facility. And I know. So be careful.
18650	The stakes are as high as they’ve ever been, if I’m not mistaken. And I’m not mistaken.
18651	We are on the cusp of achieving a new relationship with the dinosaurs. Forging revolutionary ideas because we’re able to better understand the past.
18652	And boy do we now.
18653	We’re trying to put those accidents behind us.
18654	Well, if I may... There are no accidents, simply undiscovered reasons. Our mistake... humanity’s mistake, is believing that we want to know the truth when the lie is more than enough to sustain us. These genetically manufactured dinosaurs... they’re as real as we chose to make them. We’ve manipulated and cross-bred dogs and cats and livestock for years. Why? Not for what they need, but for what we want out of the animals.
18655	And you think that’s what we’re doing now?
18656	You tell me. Any contact, no matter how slight and reasoned, introduces change. Is that not correct, Dr. Dua? Enlighten us.
18657	For now, it’s what we have to accept. Our job, my job, is to make sure these animals have the best care. As for the rest, let come what may.
18658	Yes... yes, how wonderfully, uh, chaotic of you.
18659	Even on the islands, we never created something this... this...
18660	Perfect. Well, considering we can’t let them run free, and the dinosaurs will never really know the life they should be living, it’s as perfect as can be.
18661	I guess. We should be happy.
18662	But are we? Happy?
18663	Sorta.
18664	Okay, something’s bothering you and it’s not me.
18665	No.
18666	So... what gives?
18667	This park... this isn't the dinosaurs’ final stop, is it?
18668	No... of course it's not. How could it be? It’s too dangerous to have these animals this close to civilization.
18669	Where they go, we go.
18670	You mean that, Owen? You do realize what you’re saying?
18671	We’re a team. I know you, Claire. You won’t turn your back on them... which is a bad idea by the way... never, never do that... and, and neither can I. These animals are a destiny that we can't escape. And not just you and me. Everyone. That’s something the earth needs to come to terms with.
18672	Yeah, we either make this planet right or the dinosaurs... they’ll make it theirs.
18673	With everything you have to manage, keeping an eye on the expenses can be difficult. But it is your job, and you need to stay on top of it. I’ll get you some bail out funds, but I don’t know how often I can go to the well.
18674	Taking care of dinosaurs is expensive. You know that as well as anyone. That’s why seeing you fall behind financially is concerning. Okay, look... I’m setting you up with a cash infusion, but I need you to manage the park expenses.
18675	This place is all about second chances... for the dinosaurs. You’re getting one as well with this additional funding.
18676	You may think you’re here to take care of the dinosaurs, and well, okay, I guess you are. But we want to generate income as well. You know income, right? It’s the opposite of all the out-go you’ve been doing. I’m going to authorize the funds you need, but you are now on the list. My list.
18677	People think science and vision is all you need to have dinosaurs, but John Hammond spent a good deal of his time rounding up investment. I’m going to infuse the operation with more capital, but you’re responsible for turning this place around.
18678	I know it’s not my money, technically, but it still feels like it’s coming out of my pocket. Which I obviously don’t like. So I hope you won’t be needing any more. Last chance. Make the best of it.
18679	You did it. I never had a doubt.
18680	Five stars? That’s impressive. Take a bow. You’ve earned it. Okay, that’s enough.
18681	If only every member of the team had your drive and commitment.
18682	You’ve nailed a five-star Park Rating. That’s something you can be proud of. Moments like this remind me why I enjoy working with over-achievers... like myself.
18683	Don’t think all of your hard work goes unnoticed. It does get noticed. And the animals appreciate it as well.
18684	Let’s not get too emotional, but I’ve just received word the park is now at five-stars. Okay, I may cry... a little. Privately.
18685	You’re really killing it. In the best possible way. Keep up the good work.
18686	This is why you are here. Five stars. Five. Stars. We not only have dinosaurs, we have an exceptional park where people can visit them. That’s thanks to you... and you being a team player. My team.
18687	When I first started working with the dinosaurs, I looked at them as assets, not animals. But after what I experienced at the park, I realized what was important. And that’s why I’m here now, because I see these animals for the miracles they are. And in you, I see their ally. Continue to be that and you will accomplish amazing things.
18688	Do you want the good news or the bad news? Good? You have the park at five stars. The bad... I don’t really have any. So go you!
18689	This is a cause for celebration. And that cause is you.
18690	Way to go. I wouldn’t believe what you’ve been able to accomplish if I wasn’t here to see it.
18691	This is how we win. This is how the dinosaurs win. And this is how we change hearts and minds regarding these incredible animals. We need more advocates like you.
18692	Five stars? Who would’ve thought it possible? Amazing.
18693	If I said this to Owen, I wouldn’t hear the end of it for weeks. But to you... well, “you’re doing great.”
18694	I don’t want you to get a big head or anything - trust me, we have enough of those around here already, right - but you’re are doing pretty well. The increase is Park Rating is proof.
18695	I don’t just throw out congratulations like candy. Check that... I never throw out candy. But this, well, here you go. Nice job on increasing the Park Rating.
18696	As the Park Rating goes up, your star does as well.
18697	If I didn’t know better, I’d say you're angling for my job, haha.
18698	Can you smell that? Not the dinosaurs… we leave that out of the brochures for reasons that should be obvious. No, I was referring to the sweet smell of success. That’s your work. Keep it up.
18699	I’d say I’m impressed, but I wouldn’t want you to get the right idea. Wrong... wrong idea. Ah, forget it. Nice work.
18700	At this rate, I may need to take a lesson from you, haha. Discreetly, of course.
18701	This park is really starting to take shape because of you.
18702	And here I thought all the alphas were dinosaurs. And me. But you are proving me wrong... and don’t do that by the way. What I’m trying to say is you’re an alpha too. Respect.
18703	Look at all of this phenomenal success you’ve achieved that I can take credit for. Thanks for that, haha.
18704	Just got word the rating for the park went up, apparently because of your efforts, haha. I don’t know what to say. Seriously. I don’t. Well done or something similar.
18705	I guess congratulations are in order, so I’ve ordered some. Should be here next week. I’m kidding, I kid, I kid. You done good.
18706	You keep improving the park. And that’s a bonus for us all. Including me. And you, of course, haha.
18707	I love seeing these ratings go up. Put a feather in your cap... if you have one.
18708	You’re impressing all the right people. Me.
18709	Here we go... this is the kind of news I’ve been waiting for. Due to your efforts, the rating of the park is up. I know you put a lot of work into it. Well, I assume you did, haha. Regardless, give yourself a pat on the back.
18710	Don’t get too cocky, but it looks like you’ve just pushed up the Park Rating. What can I say? Haha, well done.
18711	Maybe you can handle this paleo-curation thing after all. I’m impressed. And jealous.
18712	While I often marvel at the dinosaurs, I’m not often wowed by people. So listen when I say this: wow.
18713	You are making a park I want to visit. And I work here.
18714	I never had a doubt about your abilities... that I didn’t document in various reports. And I can admit when I’m wrong. But as long as I have a delete button, I really don’t have to. Keep up the good work. You’re clearing out my hard drive.
18715	You made it! Welcome to Canada. This is a coastal reserve that’s been abandoned, but it's a great opportunity to establish yourself as a bone-a-fide park manager. Oh and do check out the entire site... because you may well find something that can bring in the masses.
18716	This park should present a real challenge, but not how you might be tempted to think. See, in this part of Germany, the government restricts genetic manipulation. Which, is kind of our thing. So you’ll have to keep an eye on disease; these Mesozoic marvels won't fare too well against modern illnesses. How about it? Ready to give it a shot? See what I did there?
18717	Ah, the English coastline. Sand, surf and cliffs. But no tans. Oh, and a park is in ruins, and the dinosaurs are running wild. As far as I know, there’s not a lot to work with. Which is not a problem for me. You, on the other hand. Probably best to start by figuring out what went wrong. Then, do the opposite. Good luck.
18718	Here’s your chance to give guests the adrenaline-filled experiences they crave... with carnivores! Amp up everything. The mountains of the Pacific Northwest should help contain the risks. And the screams. If anything goes wrong, be prepared to take the blame. Not that anything will go wrong. That’s never happened before.
18719	Deep in the heart of America, this maze-like canyon was once the setting for some rather questionable research. But with so little foliage and severely limited resources, not much can survive in a climate like this. Those that do? Well, they're dangerous, but could be star attractions if you can convince the guests to come.
18720	Jurassic World. This... this is where our story begins.
18721	A scientific breakthrough, without any consideration of the consequences.
18722	So nature did what it does, and unleashed... chaos.
18723	This time we were deeper into the illusion of control. And the chaos brought something much worse.
18724	And for a moment, we remembered how precious life is.
18725	But time has a funny way of softening our memory of what it's like to lose control. And ambition... ambition is a persistent thing.
18726	For the dinosaurs left behind, time was becoming immaterial.
18727	From miracles of science to assets destined for exploitation.
18728	Perhaps it's time we reflect on the true nature of… nature.
18729	An endless cycle with one goal: survival.
18730	And this means that dinosaurs and humanity will have to find a way to work out their differences.
18731	Jurassic World. This... this is where our story begins. A scientific breakthrough, without any consideration of the consequences. So nature did what it does, and unleashed... chaos. This time we were deeper into the illusion of control. And the chaos brought something much worse. And for a moment, we remembered how precious life is.

And this means that dinosaurs and humanity will have to find a way to work out their differences.
18732	The mosquito, frozen in time for millions of years. And trapped within it? Well, that discovery would change our world. For a while, we thought that this was as close as we could get to dinosaurs. Turns out, we were wrong. Years of research into how to complete the DNA sequence for a dinosaur led us to this... Life unlike anything seen on this planet for sixty-five million years. Jurassic Park. We know how well THAT went. But what if someone like you had been there to temper some of that rampant hubris? For Jurassic Park to succeed, you're gonna need to make sure it's safe for all your guests. This is the adventure of their lifetime. We don’t want it to be their last.
18733	Everyone was so caught up in the moment... so impressed with what they’d accomplished. And then... chaos. A few years later the dinosaurs made their presence known again, at an island called ‘Site B’. Here was where InGen had cloned most of the dinosaurs that would eventually be transported to Jurassic Park. It was supposed to be secret. If not for human curiosity, it might have remained one. Peter Ludlow was now in charge of InGen, tasked with bringing his uncle's vision to life. John Hammond had wanted his precious animals to belong to the world. John sent a team to document the dinosaurs. What we found, to our amazement, was how quickly the dinosaurs had adapted. They had made the island their own. Ludlow had the investors. He had secured a location. But, he still needed dinosaurs. And now he knew where to get them. What if chaos yielded a different outcome? What if Ludlow's mission was successful, and Jurassic Park: San Diego had become a reality?
18734	Humanity and dinosaurs were never intended to be this close to one another. San Diego deserved better. So too, did the dinosaurs. But human beings, well, they're predictable, curious, greedy. These intruders caused more chaos than they could have anticipated. In the time we'd been away, people had gone from caretakers to threat. Simon Masrani wanted to realize John Hammond's vision. Bigger, grander, more ambitious than the original. But dinosaurs have their own ambitions. To hunt, to feed, to carve out their niche in this strange new world. Let's see how things play out when we add you to the mix. Try not to get in their way, or you might be destined to repeat the past.
18735	This is where our journey continues. And for many, where theirs came to an end. Isla Nublar. This time, it’s not just a park. It’s a world. Simon Masrani believed he could succeed where others before him failed. Maybe if he had you there to guide him, things would've turned out differently? Jurassic World was to be the most desirable destination on the planet. New shows. New exhibits. And yes, new dinosaurs, too. The miracles of science meets the magic of entertainment. They're not content with letting you see dinosaurs... no, you're being put smack dab in the middle of them. Safely. That was the hope, anyway. And whose afraid of a little water? But what’s swimming in that water... that’s another story. And if that's not enough, what about the dinosaurs nature didn't create. I mean, would you...?
18736	Each disaster, and I'm not sure what else you can call them, has intensified the scrutiny of the entire Jurassic Park, Jurassic World concept. The island belonged to the dinosaurs. And as fate would have it, nature would ultimately erase what we had unleashed. Park or no park, the dinosaurs remained. And they still deserved the chance to survive. So a group was formed. The DPG... the Dinosaur Protection Group. Led by Claire Dearing. But what if chaos had played out differently, and nature had not hit the reset button with such volcanic fury? What if Claire had the chance to go back? To see what she could do for those that were left behind? And finally gift the dinosaurs the one thing we should have given them from the start: Peace.
18737	The mosquito, frozen in time for millions of years.
18738	And trapped within it? Well, that discovery would change our world.
18739	For a while, we thought that this was as close as we could get to dinosaurs.
18740	Turns out, we were wrong.

18764	They're not content with letting you see dinosaurs... no, you're being put smack dab in the middle of them. Safely. That was the hope, anyway.
18765	And whose afraid of a little water? But what’s swimming in that water, well, that’s another story.
18766	And if that's not enough, what about the dinosaurs nature didn't create?
18767	Each disaster, and I'm not sure what else you can call them, has intensified the scrutiny of the entire Jurassic Park, Jurassic World concept.
18768	The island belonged to the dinosaurs. And as fate would have it, nature would ultimately erase what we had unleashed.
18769	Park or no park, the dinosaurs remained. And they still deserved the chance to survive.
18770	So a group was formed. The DPG... the Dinosaur Protection Group. Led by Claire Dearing.
18771	But what if chaos had played out differently, and nature had not hit the reset button with such volcanic fury? What if Claire had the chance to go back? To see what she could do for those that were left behind?
18772	And finally gift the dinosaurs the one thing we should have given them from the start: Peace.

18975	Attention Paleo-Medical personnel, we have a sick animal in need of treatment
18976	I was worried what would happen if we put these animals together, and now, unfortunately, we have our answer. There’s still so much we don’t know, so let’s learn from this, okay?
18977	I'm not sure that putting these species together was a good idea. But science is about trial and error. This was clearly the latter.
18978	Like many animals, dinosaurs will kill for food, for dominance, and for territory. We need to know what happened here.
18979	Seems strange enough that dinosaurs and humans are now living in the same space. But these animals are not only cohabiting, they're thriving.
18980	Like many living creatures, the dinosaurs can be social, and not just with their species. Diverse animals can live in harmony with one another. And this is our proof. Still, let’s make sure it lasts.
18981	These animals should be compatible. And we can gain more insight into their natural behaviors, so put them together and we’ll observe what happens.
18982	This bipedal predator is called Acrocanthosaurus, and it is a dinosaur that has what I like to refer to as “presence”. When it’s around, you know it. This animal should make for a killer exhibit, it being a killer and all, haha.
18983	This is the Albertosaurus, so named because it was first discovered in the Canadian province of Alberta. This animal is a smart predator that relies on its rows of sharp teeth. They exhibit pack behavior, which is very exciting to witness. As long as you’re doing so from a safe distance.
18984	Every dinosaur that’s recreated is important, but some also capture our imaginations. The Allosaurus is one such animal. It is believed that in its original environment, it was squarely at the top of the food chain. I’m interested to discover if that's true, given the opportunity.
18985	Well, what have we here? It’s an Amargasaurus, according to the paperwork I have in front of me. Another interesting factoid... its long neck meant it probably liked to feed on the taller branches of trees and such. At least that’s what it says. I guess we’ll find out, huh?
18986	They call this the Ankylosaurus. I call it an armored ball of walking, breathing trouble. Still, some might call it charming, amusing... delightful. Each to their own.
18987	This massive specimen is called the Apatosaurus. An impressive animal that can intimidate even the most determined of predators. The Apatosaurus’ evolutionary advantages are its size and its demeanor.
18988	There was a lot of controversy about dinosaurs being the ancestors of modern-day birds before this one was introduced into the park. It’s an Archaeornithomimus. I think it puts some of those arguments to rest.
18989	This dinosaur, the Attenborosaurus is named after the famed naturalist and documentarian David Attenborough. I guess you could say dinosaurs run in his family.
18990	This is amazing. A Baryonyx. These animals have very large claws on their first digit. This dinosaur also likes water, so take a moment to consider its needs when planning out a suitable habitat for it. The Baryonyx was originally thought to be a scavenger, but now, with live animals to study, we can find out for sure.
18991	Okay, what we have here is a Brachiosaurus. It has long limbs relative to the rest of its body, and what makes it really unique is that it’s a warm-blooded dinosaur. I mean, how amazing is it that in bringing these dinosaurs back, we're also learning so much about them.
18992	Known as the “chambered lizard”, the Camarasaurus impresses with both its size and its blunt snout. It prefers to live in groups. A challenge, but one I’m confident you can handle.
18993	Now stay with me... this dinosaur is called a Carcharodontosaurus. Talk about a mouthful, right? And seeing that this animal is an alpha-predator, its mouth is usually full of the slow, the weak and the inattentive. Hence, the reason I’m not getting near it. You on the other hand...
18994	"Nice, a Carnotaurus. You can recognize this predator immediately by the horns on its head, which give it a real rock and roll appearance. Those powerful legs can get this dinosaur moving as well, so probably best to stay out of its way. This dinosaur is so ""metal""."
18995	Honestly, the flying animals concern me the most from a security standpoint. We can round up escaped land animals, but when they take to the sky, all bets are off. This is the Cearadactylus, and we need to make sure it stays confined to the aviary. The only known species of this animal before today was named after the Latin name for “frightful”. That should tell you something.
18996	Now this dinosaur is something special. Well, they’re all special, but this one stands out because of the horns on top of its head. It’s called Ceratosaurus. It kinda looks like a slightly smaller T. rex. But its bite is probably about the same.
18997	Talk about the opposite of subtle, and I don’t mean Owen... no, this is the Chasmosaurus. It has dynamic coloring and these large openings, called fenestrae, in a frill that rises above its head. This is a dinosaur that says “look at me.” So maybe a little like Owen.
18998	First discovered in China, the Chungkingosaurus has distinctive twin plates that run along its back. And it can swing its spiked tail, called a thagomizer, like a massive medieval mace. This is a dinosaur best observed at a distance.
18999	This dinosaur is one of the earliest known animals, dating back to perhaps 216 million years ago. It’s called Coelophysis. Their remains can be found scattered across the globe. But if people want to see a Coelophysis up close, this is the only place to do it!
19000	The Compsognathus is a small predator, but don’t let its stature fool you... it can be a ruthless hunter.
19001	This dinosaur, the Corythosaurus, is a duck-billed animal that looks like it’s wearing a helmet. I mean, check that thing out. I wouldn’t want to butt heads with it.
19002	Ah, the Crichtonsaurus. Named after the author Michael Crichton. Famous for his stories about infectious viruses, sentient nanobots, and also a novel on ancient animals - which I quite enjoyed. This is a social dinosaur that does well in groups.
19003	This is a Cryolophosaurus, one of the more colorful members of the collection. It’s a carnivore, so take the necessary precautions and don’t let its looks deceive you.
19004	This dinosaur is important for a number of reasons... I mean, they’re all important. But this one, the Deinonychus was the center of debate among paleontologists for many years. Specifically, were the dinosaurs cold-blooded, or warm-blooded, animals? With them alive and in the park, we have our answer.
19005	This dinosaur, the Dilophosaurus, has a distinctive neck frill it can expand when it senses danger. It’s also been known to spit into the eyes of its prey, blinding it before it goes in for the kill.
19006	Now, you’d think a mouth full of teeth would be scary enough, but this animal, the Dimorphodon, actually has two distinct types of teeth in its jaws. And it flies. Well, more accurately, glides.
19007	Another massive animal, the Diplodocus was once considered the longest animal that ever lived. And now, thanks to our extensive research, it’s back. My task is to make sure we learn everything we can about this dinosaur. Your task is making sure these magnificent creatures can survive in the modern world.
19008	Now this dinosaur, the Dracorex, is something strange. Its name means the Dragon King of a fictional school for wizards. I think I could have come up with that myself. The name, not the dinosaur. For that, we need the scientists.
19009	This animal, though a herbivore, can intimidate most predators with its size. It’s a biggie, named Dreadnoughtus. I’d give this dinosaur a wide berth.
19010	We know this animal’s primary habitat was the ancient primordial forests that once covered this planet. It’s called Dryosaurus. Before our research, there was no information on adult specimens of this dinosaur. We only had the fossilized record of juveniles. But now, that’s all changed.
19011	Interesting... an Edmontosaurus. This is a herbivore that can move on all four feet, or go upright and walk on its hind quarters. We should be able to control and monitor this species more easily than some of the others. Use that to your advantage as you plan out the park.
19012	We know that all life began in the sea. The primordial soup. Some creatures made their way to shore, and started the chain reaction of land animals. Others stayed in the oceans, like the Elasmosaurus, and set the pattern for the marine life that would follow. This beautiful animal has a long neck and a flat tail. With the right setting, it should really attract the crowds.
19013	Ah, this is a Euoplocephalus, a herbivore and relatively harmless dinosaur, as long as you stay out of the way of the heavy club on its tail. If it swings that your way, you could be relatively finished.
19014	Some of these animals present a real test of our abilities. Take, for instance, this latest dinosaur, the Gallimimus. It's an opportunistic omnivore that does best in groups - that alone isn't the problem. But the speed... Gallimimus is incredibly fast, which presents special challenges for the ranger teams tasked with monitoring them.
19015	If you don’t think nature can be bonkers at times, then you’ve never laid eyes on this newest animal, the Geosternbergia. However, it is apparently graceful in the air. Not that I would know, but isn’t that your job?
19016	People often confuse this animal, the Giganotosaurus, with the T. rex. They look similar, act similar and both have that “eat everything within their field of vision” thing working for them. This dinosaur is also fast. Bottom line: if you find yourself running from this biggie, you’ve already made a fatal mistake.
19017	The Gigantspinosaurus you have here doesn’t quite live up to its name. Don’t get me wrong... it’s big. But manageable. Just watch out for those shoulder blades. They’d ruin anyone’s day.
19018	Now what we have here is a Herrerasaurus. It’s a carnivore and a spectacular addition to our dinosaurs. It just requires a little TLC.
19019	This flat-headed dinosaur, the Homalocephale, can appear unassuming, and perhaps, even cute, to some, but let’s also stay on top of the science. We can learn a lot from a little.
19020	My Chinese isn’t very good... okay, I don’t speak it at all... but let me give this one a try. Huayangosaurus. Nailed it, I think. Anyhoo... this is a type of stegosaur that was first discovered in the Sichuan province of China. It’s a popular species with our guests... and with crossword puzzle creators.
19021	While dinosaurs once ruled the earth, other animals ruled the seas. Take the Ichthyosaurus... a perfect example of what I’m talking about. They have a large dorsal fin, much like a dolphin. Or actually more like shark.
19022	This dinosaur is large, bulky and has a stubborn disposition. It’s called the Iguanodon. It’s a herbivore with attitude. I’d suggest giving it a wide berth.
19023	What can I say? The Indominus Rex remains my most inspired creation. Nature can create a dinosaur, but only I can bring an Indominus Rex to life. To do so required a tremendous amount of research, gene mixing, splicing and manipulation, and of course, determination. The end result is a hybrid dinosaur that is both beautiful and deadly. An alpha predator among alpha predators. So treat it with the care and respect it deserves.
19024	The Indoraptor. This is a dinosaur created with a purpose. It can even see in the dark and uses echolocation to find its prey. Now, nature might eventually have created the Indoraptor, but I got there first. Is it dangerous? Yes. But then, so is science.
19025	The Kentrosaurus is another of those spikey-backed dinosaurs. A dinosaur that relied on intimidation to keep predators at bay. And failing that, a difficult meal to catch and chew. Think of it as a prehistoric porcupine.
19026	It is the diversity of life we are discovering that I find to be most interesting. Take this animal, the Liopleurodon, for instance. This is a carnivorous marine reptile that is optimized for efficiency; both for swimming effortlessly through the water, and for relentlessly hunting its prey. And what nature created, we can re-create. And maybe, if I can be so bold, improve upon. Or at least, find ways to exploit.
19027	Okay, this latest animal is also a flier... the Maaradactylus. Its name is based on an ancient legend of a chief's daughter, her name was Maara, turned by sorcery into a river monster with long teeth that devoured fisherman. Hey, change a few of the details, and this could be my ex.
19028	This animal, the Maiasaura, is known as the “good mother reptile” because its fossils were first discovered in a nesting colony. And really, who doesn’t love a good mother?
19029	It’s dinosaurs like this, the Majungasaurus, that can really be a handful. It’s short, stocky and lives for the hunt. This is also one of the only dinosaurs we know of that may have engaged in cannibalistic behavior. Nothing like having your friends over for dinner.
19030	Okay, this dinosaur is something special. Seriously, look at the size of this thing. Called the Mamenchisaurus, this is one the largest animals to ever walk the earth. And now, thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering, it’s doing just that again.
19031	Any time you hear the word “mega”, you know you’re dealing with something significant, and the Megalosaurus is no different. This meat-eating theropod dominates any environment it finds itself in. While that's an admirable survival trait, it’s also one that we cannot accept here at the park. I want to make that clear.
19032	Let me introduce you to the Metriacanthosaurus. Say that fast three times. This is another alpha predator that, while not as big as some of its cousins, tends to stand more upright. So I guess it has good posture while it’s tearing you to shreds.
19033	So when people come to the park, they want to learn something, sure, but they also want to be entertained. And this marine reptile, the Mosasaurus, is just that... a show-stopper. If the T. rex is the ruler of the dinosaurs on land, then the Mosasaurus holds that title below the waves. Make sure this animal is a premium attraction.
19034	If it is possible for a dinosaur to be both elegant and awkward at the same time, then the Muttaburrasaurus takes the prize. This is a large herbivore that should make for an excellent addition to our collection.
19035	Do you see any resemblance between the Nasutoceratops and modern day cattle? Look closely at the horns and their relation to the eyes. It’s clear to me that as we bring these animals back to life, the connections between the past and the present... sharpen. And along with it, our understanding. This is what my science is all about.
19036	This sauropod, the Nigersaurus, was originally discovered in fossilized form in the Republic of Niger, hence the name. Now, it lives thanks to our efforts and our science. Notice the long tail. The flat skull. However, this dinosaur is smaller than some of its cousins. Now that we have them to study, perhaps we can learn why.
19037	Okay, what we have here is a Nodosaurus. This dinosaur tends to be shy and likes to keep to itself. And it has a thick skin. So, sort of the opposite of Owen.
19038	This duck-billed dinosaur is an Olorotitan. It was one of the last non-avian dinosaurs to go extinct. Until we resurrected it, that is. Now it lives to be studied and put on display. The Olorotitan is a herbivore. As it grinds away its teeth while eating, it has hundreds more that continually take their place. There’s a lesson in there somewhere.
19039	This one's more my speed. The Ouranosaurus is named after the Arabic word for “courage”, which is kinda my thing. This dinosaur is easy to care for, and really only wants a comfortable place to eat and rest. And to be left alone. Sound like anyone you know?
19040	This is the Pachycephalosaurus, or “thick-headed lizard” in Greek, which is where it gets its name. Claire has accused me of being this dinosaur more than a few times. It’s also a herbivore, so obviously, she couldn’t be more wrong. About me, I mean.
19041	They say fences make good neighbors. I say without them, dinosaurs like this one, the Pachyrhinosaurus, shouldn’t be in the park. This animal is built like a tank. And it has the personality to match.
19042	This next dinosaur, the Parasaurolophus, has a flair for the dramatic, especially where its head is concerned. It has a distinctive cranial crest, which are used for added resonance in its vocalizations and to regulate its body temperature.
19043	So the Pentaceratops here, it has five horns. One on the nose. Two on the brows. And two extending out from its jugular bones. It seems... excessive. But maybe it’s necessary.
19044	Another creature from the ancient oceans... this time a Plesiosaurus. It has a flat body, an elongated tail and four powerful flippers that help it glide through the water. Like modern day sea mammals, it has to come up for air. It basically spends its time surfing and eating which is not a bad way to live.
19045	This is the Polacanthus, and it’s covered in armor plates and spikes. Mess with this animal at your own risk.
19046	You’ve successfully introduced a new dinosaur... a Proceratosaurus. This animal is instantly recognizable by the colorful crest on its snout. While smaller in stature than some of the other predators, it is not a dinosaur to be taken lightly, let me tell you.
19047	I was concerned when it was decided to add flyers to the park, but there is no denying that the Pteranodon is a most impressive example of nature’s engineering. There is a reason we often refer to a positive event as “taking flight”. Still, my concern remains. Imagine what would happen should one of these animals get out into the wild.
19048	The more I've studied these animals, the more I've noticed that there's a fine line between fascination and fear. Prehistoric flying reptiles, like the archetypal Pteranodon, have captivated my imagination since I was young. Yet there's something about these creatures that makes me feel somewhat… cagey, shall we say?
19049	The Qianzhousaurus. Neat. Really great that we are bringing back all these fast, hungry predators. Even better that I get to stay in the office with locks on the doors.
19050	Interested in a dinosaur with an extremely long tail? Then this dinosaur is for you. It’s called the Sauropelta. Covered in bony armor, it has long spines projecting from its neck. All that being said, it is a relatively calm animal when placed in the right environment.
19051	Right. The Sinoceratops. A herbivore that shares many traits with its more famous cousin, the Triceratops. This is a docile animal that you could make into a solid favorite with a little effort. Of course, we’re all expecting more than a “little effort” but, I’m sure you get what I mean.
19052	Okay, even I have to admit that this next dinosaur is impressive. The Spinosaurus is perhaps the largest of carnivores. Of course, I’ll never get close enough to one to see for myself. But that’s why I have you.
19053	Before I got into the paleo-curation game, even I knew of the Stegosaurus. Those plates running along its length from head to tail make it one of the most iconic dinosaurs. Our guests are going to want to see it, so make sure you do right by this animal.
19054	Look at an ostrich or emu, then look at this latest dinosaur, the Struthiomimus, and tell me you don’t see a connection. This is one of the more bird-like dinosaurs that we’ve brought back from extinction. It literally has a beak instead of teeth. It’s a herbivore that prefers to move in herds. Overall, a fantastic addition to the park.
19055	This is the Stygimoloch, and it is one hard-headed dinosaur. It has an armored dome crowned by horns. Despite this, it’s a social and a relatively docile animal... unless threatened. Then, steer well clear of it. This dinosaur can do a number on its enclosures, and bash its way through any number of obstacles. Take that into consideration when you’re planning its environment.
19056	This dinosaur, the Styracosaurus, has huge horns and a large spike similar to a rhinoceros. It also has the personality to match. It's a herbivore, and uses those horns and a beak to break into even the toughest of plants.
19057	This dinosaur has a skull similar to a crocodile’s, and a disposition that isn’t that far off either. The Suchomimus originally fed on fish and small prey. Let’s make sure it doesn’t expand its diet into two-legged animals wearing collector t-shirts.
19058	What’s a show without fireworks? That’s what this next animal gives us... aerial color and excitement. And check out that sail behind its head. Spectacular. Oh, I meant to say this is the Tapejara, one of our more interesting flying species. If you couldn’t have guessed by now, I’m a fan. I think you should be too.
19059	Here we have the Torosaurus... a dinosaur that has the largest skull of any known land animal. And people say I have a big head.
19060	What can be said about the Triceratops? This is one of those dinosaurs that really defines our business. People want to see them, and we want to share them with the world. Don’t let that fearsome appearance fool you, those horns are mostly for defence. And impressing other Triceratops. This animal is a herbivore. It can be a star attraction, or a security nightmare if it turns those horns on our fencing.
19061	Personally, I don’t think the Troodon gets as much respect as it should. It’s one of those dinosaurs that seems like an evolutionary bridge... stuck in time and transition. The platypus of its day. And now, ours. It’s also incredibly interesting to study and display, so make the most of this animal.
19062	The Tropeognathus is one of the larger pterosaurs and is known for its keel-tipped snout. In the aviary, it should make for one heck of a draw.
19063	Now here is a funny little dinosaur. Correction, a pretty decent sized one if the truth be told. It’s called the Tsintaosaurus. The “t” is silent. Like the “p” in swimming. And it has a mohawk. At least, that’s what I’d call it.
19064	Remember when you were a kid and they told you not to eat then go in the water? Well, with this predator, the Tylosaurus, if you go in the water, you’re gonna get eaten. I mean, seriously, this is every sailor’s nightmare come to life.
19065	There isn’t a more iconic dinosaur than the T. rex. Even people who don't know the difference between herbivore and carnivore know all about the Tyrannosaurus Rex. And when you see her up close, feel her gaze... you understand why the T. rex was the ruler of the Cretaceous period.
19066	Everyone knows I have a soft spot for this dinosaur, the Velociraptor. And they get a bad rap, as far as I’m concerned. But if you imprint early enough, you can make real connections with them. Other than Claire, raptors are the most intelligent partners I've ever had... and like her, they could kill me in the blink of an eye. That's a joke.
19067	The MVU scan confirms what I thought... this dinosaur has a broken claw. It shouldn’t be anything to get too worried about. But it could get worse... maybe even ingrown, which would be painful... so let’s keep an eye on it.
19068	A broken tooth will likely slow this animal down. Monitor its feeding habits.
19069	Okay, you're dealing with a broken wing. For an animal that flies, this is more than a problem... it can make survival impossible.
19070	The electric fences are a necessary, if at times painful, barrier between humans and dinosaurs. For instance, this asset is showing the results of burns sustained by challenging that barrier. Do what you can for this dinosaur. Hopefully, it has learned its lesson.
19071	A concussion can lead to serious brain injury. Fortunately, this dinosaur should recover, given the proper care. And we will give it the proper care. Am I clear?
19072	We spend so much of our time and attention on the life of the dinosaurs, that we sometimes forget that part of life, is death. I feel like with each one we lose, a little part of me dies with it. But we must protect the other dinosaurs from any disease, so I need you to make arrangements to remove the carcass from the enclosure.
19073	Dinosaurs weren’t built for the Ice Age, by nature or by me. Frostbite is a whole new set of problems that must be addressed in these weather conditions. Start with this animal. It has both skin and tissue damage.
19074	Pay attention. The temperature of this dinosaur is dropping dangerously low. We haven’t had to deal with hypothermia before, but this asset is too valuable to lose. We must raise this dinosaur’s core temperature, and we must do it now.
19075	While an ingrown claw is almost certainly painful, it can also affect the animal’s behavior. And its value. I want to make sure that claw doesn’t become infected.
19076	The veterinary team's diagnosis is that this dinosaur is bleeding internally. We take action now, or the animal dies.
19077	This animal is covered in lacerations. None appears to be life threatening. In fact, in their previous life, it was quite common. The scars of survival. However, in this life, we’ll still monitor the situation.
19078	Those lacerations are not only going to be incredibly painful, but have the potential to lead to issues further down the line. Let's see if we can get those treated sooner rather than later.  
19079	I have the results of the scan. We’re dealing with a major fracture. Make sure you sedate the animal appropriately. A dinosaur in extreme pain can become even more unpredictable. We can’t have that. I hope I’m making myself understood.
19080	Yep, it’s broken, but appears to be minor. Let’s treat it before it turns into anything more serious.
19081	What good is bringing dinosaurs back from extinction if they are not properly cared for? This animal has organ damage that will prove fatal unless we act now.
19082	Hopefully, this is nothing more than a sprain. Painkillers should prove effective.
19083	This dinosaur’s wounds appear to only be superficial. Still, best to be sure. Let's get this animal the compassionate care and treatment it deserves.
19084	We want to keep foreign objects away from the dinosaurs. Based on our medical scan, this particular animal seems to have ingested something. Now we’ll have to deal with it, and the associated expense.
19085	Hello? One of the dinosaurs swallowed a guest’s phone. Hello? Get it. A little Ma-Bell humor. Of course, that reference is older than the dinosaurs. Whatever. We’ll just ring this up to happenstance. Ring... nothing? Okay, then I’m hanging up. Click.
19086	Many of these dinosaurs are naturally aggressive, especially the predators. We don't encourage this aggression, unless we can study it, that is.
19087	We don’t want to engineer aggression out of the dinosaurs, but we want to make sure we are monitoring it. And to the extent we can, controlling it.
19088	There are traits that are inherently embedded within the dinosaurs’ DNA. Aggression, for instance. Aggression is an instinctual demeanor that some animals need to survive.
19089	Yes. The Alpha. Seeing dinosaurs establish dominance. This is the very foundation of evolution. The authority of the strong.
19090	It should be relatively easy to identify the Alpha in this group of dinosaurs.
19091	Even before we brought them back, science postulated that many dinosaurs travelled in herds. The hierarchy of the pack. And now, we see it before us. In action. It’s... beautiful.
19092	The dinosaurs are always going to be testing for weaknesses. In the fences. And in us.
19093	We must keep the animals from climbing the fences. Climbing leads to breaching. And that leads to a situation we don’t want ever again.
19094	If the dinosaurs are climbing this fence, then something is wrong. Not with them. But with the fence. Electricity is a solution… That should deter the curious.
19095	Comfortable dinosaurs are manageable dinosaurs.
19096	The more comfortable our dinosaurs are, the more species-typical behavior they'll exhibit. This will improve our understanding of the animals.
19097	I want the dinosaurs comfortable. Do you?
19098	There is an ironically tragic quality to seeing a dinosaur that has been brought back from the dead, die. But death has unfortunately come for one of our animals. Clear the carcass from the enclosure before it can spread disease.
19099	We've lost one of our animals. It's unfortunate, but our first priority should be to safely remove the carcass before it contaminates the enclosure.
19100	Whenever a dinosaur dies, I feel like I’ve lost one of my own.
19101	Whenever a dinosaur dies, of course I feel it. Do you have any idea how many thousands of hours of research goes into producing just a single dinosaur?
19102	Death is inevitable for all creatures. But we lose more with a dinosaur. In science, and in our investment. The loss is incalculable.
19103	Many of these dinosaurs have unique environmental requirements. Make sure you’re meeting them.
19104	I can't get proper results for my research if the dinosaur's enclosure is unsuitable for its needs. Fix it.
19105	We are all products of our environment. Even the dinosaurs. And what I’m seeing here is a disaster in the making.
19106	They did this in the wild. Now they can fight in captivity.
19107	To some this may seem inhumane, but when we let the dinosaurs fight, or when we manipulate them to, we gain a greater understanding of the animals. This research may eventually help us to better manage them.
19108	Do I want the dinosaurs to fight? No. But do they want to fight? For some, it is what they were born for... what they live for... and what they’re willing to die for. That is a purity that few humans have.
19109	Predators that move and hunt in packs? That’s my specialty when it comes to the dinosaurs. It’s instinctive behavior Nature at its most raw and primitive. And awesome.
19110	Simply amazing. See how they work together to hunt. Coordinating their attacks. This takes planning and communication. Something we would have never conceived possible in prehistoric animals without my work.
19111	Difficult to watch, but easy to admire. Dinosaurs working together to execute the kill. They are forming groups... or more accurately, societies. And violent ones at that.
19112	It should be obvious that these dinosaurs are hungry. Food insecurity will put these animals under stress. That’s not good for them. Or us. Trust me.
19113	I want these animals in optimum condition. That means making sure they have the food they need. Don’t let them go hungry.
19114	Hey, I’ve gone, like, hours without a snack, and I know how that makes me feel. So imagine how a dinosaur feels when it’s hungry.
19115	The dinosaurs are panicking, and that’s making me nervous.
19116	Our dinosaurs are panicking. Why? Like any animal, fear drives their survival instinct. And that is coming under threat.
19117	If the animals are panicking, then you should be panicking.
19118	Calm and collected. It’s how I live my life. Other than, you know, when I’m being chased by dinosaurs or molten lava.
19119	Environment is destiny. Make the scenery in the enclosures more compatible with what the dinosaurs experience in nature.
19120	I’m researching how different these dinosaurs would be with different scenery. You should take that as a call to action.
19121	The dinosaurs are both science and art. Their enclosures should be as well. Don’t mock nature, mimic it.
19122	We have sick dinosaurs in need of immediate treatment. See to it.
19123	Nobody likes a sick dinosaur. Especially me. So why don’t we get this animal the treatment it needs, huh?
19124	I’ve made the dinosaurs as best I can, but sickness is a reality. And treatment is a necessity.
19125	One would think that being brought back from extinction would be stressful enough, but apparently, no. I’ve reviewed the data, and these animals are in distress. Figure out why, and deal with it.
19126	When I’m working with the raptors, they know... I’m one of them. No stress. That’s what we want with the animals.
19127	These dinosaurs won’t be the only thing feeling stress if you don’t get them calm and back under control. In case I’m not clear, I am referring to you.
19128	When the animals are nervous, so am I. Comes with the territory. And I shouldn’t have to remind you that ours is full of dinosaurs.
19129	Oh boy. I've seen this before, and I can tell you right now that we have a situation on our hands. When it comes to dealing with raptors, I always set out to be the alpha of the pack. But, the genetic bond that ties the species to the Indominus Rex is something that I simply can't compete with. That territory belongs to them... and it's the Indominus that's in charge.
19130	Water is the foundational element of life. Without it, we can’t survive. The dinosaurs are no different. They need water, and you need to provide it.
19131	Environmental pressures like a lack of water causes undue stress on the animals and can incite conflict. What do you plan to do about it?
19132	Nothing drives an animal, or human, to madness quicker than thirst. And we could use a little less madness in the park. So make sure the dinosaurs have access to drinking water.
19133	The numbers are in... and, to put it bluntly, our financials are a disaster. Fortunately, for me, this has your name all over it. More to the point, I’m not sure how much longer we can keep the doors open. Or, at this rate, the gates shut.
19134	Who doesn’t like money? You apparently... Here’s a tip: be more like me.
19135	If you can’t handle the numbers, how can you handle the dinosaurs? They go claw in hand. This may call for drastic measures on your part. You’ve got to turn things around. Look, I don’t want to play the “blame game” here, but just know... I’m a master at it.
19136	These numbers are looking great. And they're making me look great. Oh, and you... are looking good, too. In your own way.
19137	Solid financials are the cornerstone of this whole business. Money makes even the prehistoric world go around. We’re looking good. Keep it up.
19138	I like what I’m seeing, and what I’m seeing is all the numbers moving in the right direction. Let’s keep the park in the black, because when it’s in the red, it can really get covered with it. Red, I mean... not ink. What I’m saying is that’s a problem we want to avoid at all costs. Well, some cost, anyway.
19139	You need to look at improving our bottom line. At the moment, it’s a bit... disappointing.
19140	Clearly, there is a lot on your plate. But at the rate you’re burning cash, there’s not going to be much on mine. Focus on getting us profitable, will ya?
19141	We’re like the ultimate petting zoo... minus the petting. Dinosaurs. Din-o-saur-s. They should sell themselves. So what’s the problem? Or more to the point, who is the problem? And what are you-who going to do about it?

19402	That's not our objective
19403	Check your target
19404	That asset shouldn't be our focus
19405	It's not our priority
19406	Focus on the primary asset
19407	Asset ID does not match our target
19408	Make sure you're prioritizing the target asset
19409	There's another asset we need to tranq
19410	We tranqing the primary asset next?
19411	I don't think that's right. Check the ID
19412	Those domes for the flyers sure are impressive. Until they break.
19413	The miracle of prehistoric flight, under the miracle of modern engineering. Do it right, and the aviaries are breathtaking examples of paleo-curation.
19414	Why buy off the shelf when you can go custom? Because it’s cheaper, duh. But everyone believes the more unique the park, the more the guests will love it. Maybe worth a try.
19415	We made this place for the dinosaurs, but that doesn’t mean you can’t make it your own. Look at customizing the park. It should pay dividends.
19416	We can’t all get it right all the time. Sometimes, the only answer is to tear it down and start over. Oh, and pro tip, change your number and deactivate your social profile, too.
19417	When it all goes to pot, sometimes the best course of action is to start over. Don’t like it? delete it.
19418	If you know anything about real estate, waterfront property is always more valuable. I’d think the same would hold true for a lagoon. Why don’t you find out?
19419	Look at bringing all of these smaller pools together into one large lagoon. It will not only be more impressive, but the animals should enjoy the extra space as well.
19420	Some of these buildings could definitely use some TLC. And I could definitely use a BLT. Where is it?
19421	Given what we are dealing with dinosaur-wise, maintenance and repair is a constant, but necessary, evil. We can all agree we don’t want any dodgy facilities in the park.
19422	Aviary domes allow the flyers some limited mobility. Frankly, these are the animals that make me the most nervous. So let’s keep ‘em content.
19423	The flyers are some of our most amazing animals. We want to make sure we give them an environment worthy of their majesty.
19424	Some of these dinosaurs are able to get along with one another. Unlike me and my ex.
19425	Having companions of other species together in a single enclosure can be a kerfuffle. But when it works, it’s simply brilliant.
19426	Remember that every animal has special requirements - food, environment, socialization and the like if they are to be comfortable. Make sure you’re taking care of that, otherwise you might face a lawyer pointing out all the ways you failed as a provider. Wait, I didn’t mean to say that last thing out loud.
19427	You know how there are places you feel most at home? These animals are no different. Their comfort levels are directly related to how we are caring for them. Do they have the right environment? Food? Enclosure mates? It makes all the difference.
19428	Death is a part of life. But in the park, we’d like to deal with it as quickly as possible. So have a Transport Team collect the carcass before any of the guests start asking questions.
19429	The miracle is that the dinosaurs live at all. But that means they also must eventually die. Tragic, but still, we soldier on even when something like this happens. Alert a Transport Team and have them remove what’s left of the animal.
19430	Food... it’s a strong motivator. And we don’t want hangry dinosaurs. So make sure they’re being properly fed.
19431	Not only will the herbivores eat from the feeders, but if you place the right plants in their enclosures, they’ll dine right from the source.
19432	If the fences are weak, I hope your legs are strong, 'cause you're running a heck of a risk, huh?
19433	These dinosaurs are always looking for weaknesses in our parks. Anything they can exploit. Keeping the fencing strong and secure is a must.
19434	Keep the security ratings for the animals and their enclosures high, and we won’t have to deal with the low of another breakout. Simple.
19435	No one wants another... event. And we can avoid getting all wobbly if we keep the fence Security Ratings as high as possible. So I think we should, don’t you?
19436	We all know what can happen when these dinosaurs attack. Same holds true when they go after each other. Now I’m not saying I’m happy about this, but given the choice of us or them, well, do I really have to say?
19437	In the park, we celebrate nature. Even at its most brutal. Sometimes, these animals will attack one another. And that means that, unfortunately, it may be fatal to the loser. This is the law of the jungle. Even the one we created.
19438	We’re talking about primal instincts. Some animals need to hunt. And some need to golf.
19439	These dinosaurs have been optimized by evolution to be predators. They don’t want to hunt... they need to. They’ll search for prey until they find it. Or until we provide it.
19440	What would the park be without dinosaurs? Quieter? Safer? Probably smell nicer. And be completely boring. So incubate some more dinosaurs. Because we’re all about excitement. And entertainment. And the dinosaurs, of course. Oh, and money.
19441	Isn’t incubating new dinosaurs just the most exciting thing ever?
19442	Usually they’re making a mess, but the truth is, this dinosaur is a mess. We’ve got a major injury here. Transport it to the Paleo-Medical Facility and let’s see what they can do.
19443	This dinosaur’s injury appears to be relatively minor. So don’t muck about. Send out an MVU Team. They should be able to give the animal a proper patching up.
19444	These animals need room to swim. Think Olympics more than hot tubs.
19445	The lagoon needs to be large enough to support our animals. They need to be able to swim freely. But not free, obviously.
19446	We’ve invested in these MVUs to help us diagnose problems with the animals. Don’t waste the expense.
19447	Trying to evaluate an animal’s condition visually, well... it’s not enough, is it? That’s why you should use an MVU. A scan can let us know what is really happening with the animal.
19448	Last time I focused on plants like this, it was my gap year, as I hitched across the west. But, uh, enough about this old dinosaur, and more about the ones in our care. They need the right plants as well.
19449	Our prehistoric plants may not be quite as exciting as the dinosaurs, but they are just as important. Make sure the animals have the plants they need to stay healthy and happy.
19450	We need to stay on top of the animals’ welfare. They’re no good as attractions, or to the scientists, if they’re unhealthy. Send out a Ranger Team to check up on them.
19451	Ranger Teams should perform regular status checks on the dinosaurs. If you haven’t done one recently, I’d suggest you do.
19452	You need to synthesize the DNA of the dinosaur first, then incubate it. I don’t know what any of this means, but they wrote it down here for me. And by extension, you.
19453	Before we can incubate a new dinosaur egg, we first need to synthesize its DNA. I have every confidence you can handle this.
19454	These dinosaurs need their space. A place to call home. You can join enclosures together to give ‘em more.
19455	Like many animals, the dinosaurs can be territorial. They may need more space to feel less stressed. And, you know, less enclosed by their... enclosures.
19456	This dinosaur is getting a little too close for comfort vis-a-vis our guests. Let’s have a Capture Team tranq it and move it to a safer location. For the guests, and for the dinosaur. Plus, I worked in a little French there if you were paying attention.
19457	Before it becomes more of a problem, we should move this dinosaur. A Transport Team can relocate it to a safer enclosure. You might need a Capture Team to tranquilize it first. Use every precaution.
19458	Everybody likes a nice place to lay their head down at night. Especially after a day of dinosaur-related adventure. Hotels are the answer, and also increase guest comfort.
19459	Once we have our guests at the park, we’d like them to stay. Having accommodations like a nice hotel is the answer.
19460	We put the “dine” in dinosaurs. How’s that for a marketing “hook”? Right? Oh, and remember, guests who are enjoying their experience are more willing to open their wallets and purses.
19461	Everyone likes a bit of food, a nice drink and some entertainment. Provide the guests with some great amenities and we should see a tidy profit.
19462	Attractions should, you know, attract. Hence the name. Your Appeal Rating is what your guests think of what you’ve created. You can’t fool them. And believe me, I’ve tried.
19463	The more appealing your attractions, the better rating you’ll get.
19464	Size matters... for the dinosaurs and our operation. And we aim to impress. So consider expanding the park by purchasing more land. That will allow us to serve more guests. Which also means more folks making the scene with the green. And I ain’t talking dino skin.
19465	There comes a time when you’ve just outgrown your current situation and you need more space. Fortunately, you can buy more land to expand the park. Make it absolutely ginormous if you think you can handle it. And added space means more dinosaurs, guests and revenue. Crack on with it when you’re ready.
19466	It’s not enough to see the dinosaurs, some folks want to be close to them as well. Call them crazy if you want. But call me crazy too, because they represent an opportunity for us. True hard-core dinosaur fanatics. We can cater to them with guided tours and viewing galleries. An adventure of multiple lifetimes. And they can only get it here.
19467	You can see these animals, or you can experience them through viewing galleries and guided tours. A multi-sensory encounter with our prehistoric past.
19468	If we’re trying to bring in guests that love adventure, then focus on attractions that provide thrills and dinosaurs that provide chills and Bob’s your uncle.
19469	Lots of dinosaurs and keep it cheap. There’s no reason not to give it a try, and it should provide us with a decent cross-section of our core interest group.
19470	Who doesn’t like the finer things in life. Guests interested in a luxurious experience don’t mind paying for more, as long as they think it’s worth it. A variety of animals is also a huge plus.
19471	Some of these guests just want to immerse themselves in nature. Their desire is to see comfortable and healthy animals.
19472	The true measure of success is how satisfied our guests are when they visit the park. And guess what? They want to see healthy, content dinosaurs. Who knew? Well, even if I didn’t, you should have. So watch your Dino Welfare Rating.
19473	The status of our operations is reflected by the Dinosaur Welfare Rating. It indicates the care of our animals. People don’t like seeing dinosaurs that appear neglected. That... that could spell trouble all around.
19474	If you haven’t guessed by now, keeping dinosaurs is an expensive endeavor They require a steady stream of revenue to live the lifestyle to which they’ve become accustomed, in the words of my ex. You know the saying, more money, more problems? My answer is, I’ll take both.
19475	It does seem just a little crass to say, but we do need the park to be profitable. And that's something you should focus on... the money. When our bottom line is strong, then the park is strong.
19476	Make sure you focus on our monthly objectives. We’re playing the long game. Mmm.
19477	There are so many details to look after in the park that we sometimes lose sight of the bigger picture. That’s why it’s always worth tracking the monthly objectives.
19478	Want a better rating? Put more money in the till. It’s always worked for me.
19479	Keep the park profitable and our ratings should improve. It sounds so simple, doesn’t it? But it’s not.
19480	They say all publicity is good publicity. As far as I’m concerned, spell my name right and you can say anything you want. But if our Publicity Rating is up, we’re gonna see more folks wanting to visit. And the way I see it, nothing bad, or dangerous, or scary ever happens around the dinosaurs. Because I refuse to look.
19481	What a privilege it is... us being able to work with dinosaurs. We want our guests to have that same sense. To realize they are part of something bigger and grander than themselves. True happiness, that. It’s the kind of publicity we can’t buy. And also can’t afford to do without.
19482	If somebody needs to talk to a man about a dinosaur, they usually prefer someplace close to complete the transaction. So check your Restroom Coverage.
19483	When people have to go, they don’t want to go far. Yes, I’m taking about the toilet. A good distribution of porcelain will be appreciated when guests need a wee.
19484	Bad things happen. Even to good people. It’s a fact of life. Even more so when some of that life comes from millions of years ago. Still, injuries and… deaths… let’s downplay that and work on our Safety Rating. We want to keep visitors coming, so there’s no need to dwell on the past in a park full of dinosaurs.
19485	There is so much wonder here. And occasionally, danger. That’s always been part of the allure of the dinosaurs, hasn’t it? I mean, you have to be a little barmy to get close to them. But still, we want guests through those gates, and that means watching our Safety Rating.
19486	If things go wrong, and I’m not saying that they will... even though they do... we want shelters where our guests can hide out. Also helps cut down on the red-tape and red concrete.
19487	If things go pear-shaped, then getting people safely to shelters must be our primary mission. Check that you have enough Shelter Coverage to deal with such a reality should it pay us a visit.
19488	The monorail is both fun and impressive. The more connected the network, the easier it is for our guests to get around.
19489	There’s something wonderfully anachronistic about a monorail moving through the land of the dinosaurs, don’t you think? And it improves our Transport Coverage. Brilliant.
19490	Hey, people come to the park to see dinosaurs. That’s why there’s “Jurassic” in the name. So you wanna make sure your Viewing Galleries are properly placed.
19491	The dinosaurs are our spectacle the guests come to see. It’d be a shame if we let them down... so don’t forget the Viewing Galleries. We want their jaws to drop as the dinosaurs’ jaws snap.
19492	We’ve brought dinosaurs back from extinction, but we still can’t control the weather. Don’t forget to monitor it. When the weather goes bad, usually that’s when things start going south in the park.
19493	We can't always predict the weather but we should be prepared to react to it. The dinosaurs can get quite agitated so be ready to respond.
19494	Control the air, control the battlefield. True then, and more true now that… now is then. Again. What I mean is that a Capture Team chopper overhead can provide an extra layer of protection for our teams on the ground.
19495	If you have a Capture Team helicopter hovering over our Ranger Teams in the field, they’ll have more protection when they need to interact with the animals. Think of it as levelling the playing field, but from above.
19496	If you think you can handle it, you can always activate an additional Ranger Team.
19497	The more hands, the better, I say. If you need another Ranger Team, you should consider adding one.
19498	Our Ranger Teams are ready, willing and able. They only need direction. Which you should provide. I mean, I can’t do everything around here. Okay, truth is, I can’t do many things around here. But still... you know.
19499	This should help take a load off... you can assign tasks to your Ranger Teams and they’ll do the rest. Well, most of it, anyway.
19500	The phrase I’m thinking of is “borrowed time.” What do I mean, you ask? Well, we needed to delay that inbound animal for a couple of minutes. But, uh, let me know when it's time to roll out the red carpet, huh?... I'm not gonna miss that one!
19501	Well, we are dealing with dinosaurs, so the unexpected is bound to happen. If you're not ready for a delivery, then it's usually best to buy yourself a couple of minutes.
19502	Apparently, the Rangers are good at tracking wild dinosaurs if you can find some clues for them to follow. Like me and good barbecue. I can smell that smoke for miles.
19503	When I was younger, I used to love a good game of hide and seek. You win by outsmarting and out-observing your opponent. The Rangers can be used to do the same to track the dinosaurs.
19504	With drones, you can carry out assignments in aviaries and at lagoons that you couldn’t otherwise reach. Just don’t let the animals think they’re some new type of food.
19505	Technology plays such an important role in our paleo-curation Drones are a perfect example. We can use this relatively new innovation to keep track of animals from millions of years ago. Amazing, isn’t it?
19506	Make sure you keep an eye on your local resources. Those levels will need to be topped up every now and then; believe it or not, this park isn't going to run itself!
19507	If we want to keep the park running smoothly, you'll need to make sure your local resources are topped up. Running on empty is never going to end well. 
19508	Try to lock-on while targeting. It’ll allow you to tranq a dinosaur while still on the move.
19509	The lock-on feature should prove helpful when trying to bring down a dinosaur. It means you can fire tranquillizer darts while in motion.
19510	Regular visits to the Ranger Posts by Team Patrols will help monitor the dinosaurs’ welfare.
19511	Some fresh air is always good, isn’t it? So have the Ranger Patrols check in on their Post locations. Everything in their vicinity is being monitored, and, with regular visits, we can monitor how the dinosaurs are getting along.
19512	I’ve taken a few photos in my day. Even so, my better ones only get a few likes on social media. Maybe it’s me... nah. Anyway, you might have better luck. Shoot the dinosaurs and earn a few bucks. Shoot with a camera, I mean.
19513	We share the dinosaurs at the park. But we can also capture a moment in time with them through photography. Take some dinosaur snaps and you might even make a few quid in the process. What’s not to love?
19514	Danger is ever present in the parks. That’s why I try to stay in the office. Away from the biting and the storms. But your Rangers, well, they’re another story. So make sure you take care of them, because I don’t want the paperwork if you don’t.
19515	The safety of our people is, of course, a top priority. Take care of the Rangers, and protect them if the animals get a little too close for comfort.
19516	Need more power? Don’t look at me... maybe putting down a Backup Generator can get you what you need.
19517	If you don’t have enough Power Stations, a temporary Backup Generator can do the job in a pinch.
19518	What good is power if you can’t wield it? Of course, I’m talking about electricity. Which, in this case, means creating a distribution network.
19519	Substations can help distribute the energy from the Power Stations spread throughout the park.
19520	Power. It’s what we all want. And what the park needs. So get some Power Stations online.
19521	As the park gets bigger, so too does your energy consumption. That means more Power Stations, and more infrastructure. If you’ve really overcooked it, you can shut down power to some of your buildings. It’s a temporary fix, but it can be the difference between inconvenience and crisis.
19522	Every system in the park is putting a strain on the power network. Make sure the Power Stations can handle the load.
19523	Successful power management is really about finding a balance between what the facilities need from a power standpoint, and how much energy you have available from the grid.
19524	We could definitely use a few building upgrades. Assign one of the scientists to it... they can apply their skills to the task and we can reap the benefits.
19525	Ultimately, our greatest resource, other than the dinosaurs, is our people. And we can use them to help upgrade our infrastructure. Buildings, for example. Assign a scientist to an upgrade task and see what happens.
19526	Send a scientist out on this next expedition. Maybe they can bring something back from the field.
19527	This animal could be a difficult capture. Having a scientist with knowledge of its behaviors should make things easier. The last thing we want is for things to go sideways.
19528	Apparently, we can get more DNA, and increased genome from the fossils if we assign a scientist to do the extraction. I’m not sure what all that means, but it sounds good, so you should probably follow through on it. On that. On this. You know.
19529	The lifeblood of the park, and of the research that creates our animals, is our Dinosaur Genome library. If we can extract more Genome from fossils, then we can look at a greater variety of species that might be candidates for the park. Assigning a scientist to the process will improve our chances.
19530	You should consider hiring more scientists. Look at their skills and salary demands. Especially their salary demands.
19531	Of course our version of paleontology requires a team of scientists. And they will, obviously, cost money to hire. Your job is to make sure we are getting the best people for our investment.
19532	Incubation. That’s how our eggs become attractions. I mean, dinosaurs. Regardless, a scientist in the loop on this makes things run smoother. And around the park, who’d say “no” to that?
19533	The development of a new dinosaur from egg to mature animal takes dedication and care. A scientist monitoring that development every step of the way helps ensure success.
19534	The old life around here is dependent on a steady stream of new data. So get one of the scientists on this new research. If it works out, everyone will know that I lit the fire. And you know why? Because I’m going to tell them, of course.
19535	Without research, we have no dinosaurs, and without dinosaurs, what are we? So I’d say research is of extreme importance. Consider doing more of it by assigning a scientist.
19536	Who doesn’t love a little vay-cay, right? Well, our Scientists can suffer from burnout, so why not give ‘em some rest and relaxation? We want these scientists sharp. Maybe give 'em some time in the Staff Centre. You have one, right?
19537	It’s easy to find yourself completely engrossed in your work, especially here at the parks. But these scientists will need some time off. And they’d appreciate a Staff Centre. It’ll give them a chance to recharge and come back more energized than ever. Bottom line... it's worth it.
19538	My sense has always been that when sabotage comes, it'll be from within. Probably from a disgruntled contractor that feels overworked and undercompensated. So keep an eye on everyone. No one is above suspicion. We don’t want or need any close shaves.
19539	I know this is hard work, and the pressure can get to anyone. That’s why we need to do our best to keep the scientists feeling content and satisfied. Unhappy scientists lead to unhappy dinosaurs... and that leads us all to an unhappy place.
19540	Okay, here are the skills that you can track to gauge a scientist’s ability. Logistics, Genetics and Welfare. Check their ratings and make sure they’re a good fit for your missions. And hey, I don’t want to have to micro-manage, here. Just regular manage-managing is more than enough for me.
19541	Don't forget to keep track of your scientists’ skill ratings. You may find that some are more suited than others to the task at hand.
19542	I like my eggs over easy. The scientists like their eggs with a dinosaur embryo inside. And they say I’m weird. Anyway, assign a scientist to a modified genome and create some eggs. At least you won’t have to sit on them.
19543	All life starts as some type of egg. If you task a scientist with synthesizing a genome, we should have new eggs to incubate. And that should be exciting for everyone.
19544	Hey, we’re paying a lot for these scientists... okay, maybe not a lot, but enough... anyway, make 'em earn their keep. Get ‘em working.
19545	This particular task could definitely use more attention. Perhaps you should consider assigning a scientist to help you out.
19546	Hey, I’m as willing to get my hands as dirty as the next guy. Okay, actually, I’m not. I guess you’d call me something of a germaphobe. Or lazy. Either or. Dealer’s choice. But these scientists, they need all the experience and training they can get. So see that they get it.
19547	Knowledge and experience... this is what we need most in dealing with the dinosaurs. We are so on the far edge of what is possible that any training we can get, or provide, is invaluable. And it should improve the skills of our Scientists.
19548	There are people who do certain things well. They have an area of expertise. They focus. And then there are people like me, who do a lot of things well... enough. In the park, we need both.
19549	We need to look for both specialists, and generalists, when it comes to Scientists for the park. The animals will benefit from a diverse workforce of scientists.
19550	Solid buildings form the foundation of our parks. You see what I did there... buildings... foundation. Construction humor. Anyhoo, it’s true. See what you can hammer out by researching the subject. Boom. That’s two.
19551	While the dinosaurs are the star attractions, it is our facilities that make it all possible. Dinosaurs need people, and people need buildings. Research gives us the ability to create new and upgraded ones.
19552	A.B.R. Always be researching. You want the good leads, you want the Jurassic Geologic Period leads? First, put that coffee down, and get your scientists to work on some research.
19553	I’m an everyday learner. I think everyone should be. There’s still so much we don’t know... about the dinosaurs, and about how to best take care of them. Researching new facilities is the key to a successful park.
19554	This line of research makes me nervous, but the scientists think it will lead to breakthroughs. As long as they’re not talking about the gates and fences, who am I to argue?
19555	Don’t forget to research new gene modifications. Maybe it’ll lead to something interesting.
19556	Gene mods? Who needs ‘em? Am I right? According to everyone else, “no.” That makes you wrong too. So get on ‘em.
19557	Yay... more dinosaurs to unlock. That’s always a good thing that’s never gone wrong before. But seriously, if they add value, go for it.
19558	It looks like there's a new species available to research. Can you imagine introducing one of those to the park?
19559	Who’s not interested in new dinosaurs? You, obviously. My advice... reconsider this.
19560	“New”... it’s kind of a code word for more, better, faster, bigger... scarier. That’s what people want, new dinosaurs. And we should be ready to give them to them.
19561	We should have a scientist assigned to each node of research. That’ll improve our chances of success, and also keep them from plotting with one another.
19562	The scientists are fountains of knowledge. One on each node of research should produce great results.
19563	Fantastic job. Well done.
19564	Okay, don’t let this go to your head, but you did good. Better than good. Great, maybe, but don’t push it.
19565	I’m so proud of you. Seeing it through to the end like that. Good job.
19566	If we can get ahead of potential diseases, then we’ll be ready to stop an outbreak before it begins. Research what you can about treatments and inoculations.
19567	Dinosaurs are already a handful. Sick dinosaurs doubly so. That’s why research into treatment is important. If you’ve ever had a dinosaur sneeze on you, you wouldn’t question this.
19568	I’ve been told that having a comfortable home is the key to happiness. I haven’t been able to confirm that as of yet, but there’s no reason not to think that works for the dinosaurs too. Research upgrades for the enclosures and see what you can discover.
19569	You can research upgrades for the animals’ enclosures. The more content the dinosaurs are within their habitat, the more manageable they should be. One goes with the other.
19570	We’re lucky to have Claire Dearing on our team. She can sometimes be a pain in the side, but I think that comes from her passion for the dinosaurs. Or maybe she doesn’t like me. She wouldn’t be the first. Or the second. Or the third. You get what I’m saying.
19571	Claire Dearing... she’s gone from manager to advocate. She's a survivor. A result of her interactions with the dinosaurs and her headstrong nature.
19572	If you’d already met Cabot Finch, trust me, you’d know it. In a place full of larger than life personalities, he stands out. Like a T. rex in a gift shop.
19573	This is Cabot Finch. Like many people involved in the parks, a sometimes necessary inconvenience. Although he does have his moments.
19574	George Lambert deals with security, and considering all that entails, he often has his hands full. With claws, and teeth and, uh... tails.
19575	Our goal at the park is to keep guest count to the maximum, and the body count to a minimum. George Lambert is the man tasked with that... task. Mr. Lambert?
19576	If things go wrong, we need men like George Lambert around. He’s our security specialist. If there's an issue we should be concerned about, he’ll know.
19577	Without Dr. Henry Wu, none of this would exist. He has that drive and intensity that few people possess. My advice? Don’t get on his bad side.
19578	This entire operation started with a dream that was realized through science. For that, we can thank Dr. Henry Wu.
19579	Have you had a chance to meet Isaac Clement? His job is to make what we do here with the dinosaurs entertaining, because these animals need more than just care, they need to be understood. And if people enjoy their time with the dinosaurs, they’re more likely to support our cause.
19580	I mean, what good is bringing dinosaurs back from extinction if you can’t find a way to make that fun and exciting? And profitable. That’s where Isaac Clement comes in. He deals with the show, I deal with the business.
19581	All of this is founded in both science and commerce. That’s where Isaac Clement comes in. He makes my... He makes our dinosaurs, entertaining.
19582	Let me introduce Dr. Ian Malcolm. He’s something of a celebrity among the folks that work in paleo-curation There at the beginning. And always warning of the end.
19583	Dr. Ian Malcolm? This is an unexpected surprise. Something we try to avoid, actually. What brings you to my lab?
19584	This is Dr. Kajal Dua. She’s all about the science of paleo-curation When she talks... I’d suggest you listen.
19585	Dr. Kajal Dua... I’d ask what brings you here, but I’m not sure I’d get an answer.
19586	Dr. Kajal Dua is a fellow scientist who is helping expand our work. Based on my research, of course.
19587	Owen may come off as a bit of free-spirit, because truth be told, he is, but he’ll also tell you the truth, even if you don’t want to hear it. My advice: listen when he speaks. Owen has the experience, and he’s spent more time face to snout with the dinosaurs than just about anyone else. And lived to tell the tale, and brag about it.
19588	This is Owen Grady. He’s an animal behaviorist that specializes in training Velociraptors. Which means that he’s a little... what’s the word I’m looking for... “determined”? I say that with all respect, of course.
19589	Owen Grady. Animal behaviorist and our resident Velociraptor trainer. He believes in hands-on work with these animals, so if you need anything from him, I suggest you get it now. While he's still alive.
19590	Okay, I’m Isaac Clement. Together, we’ll create the most spectacular dinosaur park imaginable. And hopefully not die in the process. Really, I don't wanna die...
19591	Hi. I’m Claire Dearing. I’m extremely passionate about the dinosaurs and about our responsibility to take care of them.
19592	I’m Dr. Kajal Dua. And while you’re keeping an eye on the dinosaurs, I’ll be keeping an eye on you.
19593	Right. I hope you’re getting settled in, because there’s plenty to do, and you’re just the person to do it. I’m Cabot Finch, and I’m kinda in charge here at the parks. Until things go wrong.
19594	Hey, Owen Grady here. I’ll keep it brief. And that’s it. Done.
19595	Dr. Henry Wu, here. Geneticist.
19596	I’m George Lambert, in charge of security, and I just want to remind you that the safety of our guests and our dinosaurs, well, that’s “job one”.
19597	I’m going to assume you know me. Or more precisely, know of me. I’m Dr. Ian Malcolm, and dinosaurs have become my life. Not voluntarily, mind you.
19598	Hey, my name is Isaac Clement, and it’s great to finally meet you. I hope you’re ready, because the dinosaurs can’t wait to meet you too.
19599	Hi! I'm Claire Dearing. I know it must be overwhelming to meet all these new people. You're about to embark on a life-changing adventure. It certainly was for me. Trust me, you'll understand.
19600	Science is everything. It brought the dinosaurs back from beyond the brink. And it is keeping them here now. I hope you understand how vitally important this is. Ah, I haven’t introduced myself. Dr. Kajal Dua. You need to be as passionate about our work as I am. I’ll accept no less.
19601	This is where we start... with the right people. People like me, Cabot Finch. It takes a special breed of human to deal with these breeds of dinosaurs, I think. Let’s see if you’re up to it.
19602	I'm Owen, a specialist in dinosaur behavior I’ve formed a unique bond with the raptors. Now, don't be jealous.
19603	I'm Dr. Henry Wu. I'm a scientist. Some might call me an artist, a sculptor. My sculptures are living, breathing dinosaurs.
19604	While the parks have become famous for dinosaurs, it’s not quite the way we’d want. Hopefully, working together, we can change that. Sorry, meant to introduce myself. George Lambert, security specialist. Our challenges are many, so let’s not waste any time.
19605	Dr. Ian Malcolm here. Some refer to me as our resident sceptic. I, however, I prefer “realist”.
19606	"Hey, I’ve heard a lot about you, so here’s a little about me. I’m Isaac Clement, but just call me Isaac. No need for formalities. Besides, in the park, we’ve got to watch each other’s backs.
Now, people think we’re in the dinosaur game, but the truth is... we’re entertainers. And our headliners travelled sixty-five million years to make the show. So let’s make it a good one."
19607	Welcome to your future, and our past. I’m Claire Dearing. I used to be management... until things went awry... now I’m more of an advocate. John Hammond wanted a world with dinosaurs. And I want us to take care of them. I hope you do as well.
19608	Allow me to introduce myself. I’m Dr. Kajal Dua. I’m something of a perfectionist, and I demand it in others. So I expect that you’ll do your best. I just wanted to make that clear. Oh, and welcome.
19609	I’m Cabot Finch. Don’t think of yourself as working for me, but instead think of your job as working with the dinosaurs, while working for me.
19610	I work with the dinosaurs, and now you do too. I'm Owen Grady. From my experience, I've learned the most important thing is to respect these animals, because if you don't... they won't have any trouble making you their next meal.
19611	Nothing gets past me, especially mistakes. Make sure you're paying attention to the details, or you'll be hearing from me. Who am I? Dr. Henry Wu.
19612	My name is George Lambert. Now, you’d think that dealing with prehistoric animals would be a problem, and you’d be right, as you’ve probably discovered. But it’s the unpredictability that really keeps us on our toes. Sure, the scientists can bring dinosaurs back, but fences keep them in. Without them, the fences, I mean, none of this is possible.
19613	Chaos brought us together. And the dinosaurs may tear us apart. Literally. But for now, let's do our best to keep that from happening, shall we?

20030	That won't help it
20031	When we build great things, we build ourselves. Inspirational, right? And original.
20032	What I like about building construction is that it requires planning. And thought. And I’ve always loved seeing things become something from nothing. I think that’s what first attracted me to InGen.
20033	Let’s get some new buildings in place. We’re a professional outfit and we need world-class facilities.
20034	We need more buildings. And you know what they say... “it’s better to be the hammer than the nail.”
20035	The park needs support facilities, like new buildings. Restaurants, shops... pit stops. And I don’t mean the kind for race cars.
20036	It’s time to take this building to the next level. Permits, schmerits... I’m not signing anything.
20037	You need to optimize what you have if you want to succeed.
20038	Upgrading these buildings should make them more profitable, more efficient, and more secure.
20039	We’re always improving... always looking for new ways to make the park a world-class destination. Change is progress. Let’s focus on building upgrades for now and you’ll see what I’m talking about.
20040	Let’s think about sprucing this place up a bit. Doesn’t have to be posh, but at least, consider an upgrade.
20041	"(monster truck announcer) Sunday, Sunday, Sunday... it’s time for action. Warriors from Earth’s prehistoric past. Travelers through time. Ancient blood brothers pitted against one another... and there will be blood, brothers. This is a fight to the finish.
(back to his voice) I always wanted to do that. Jurassic radio? Not the worst idea, right?"
20042	I’m not indifferent to what happens when we pit these animals against one another. These are my creations, and I hate to lose a single one. But let's be honest, to cook up a dinosaur, you've got to be willing to crack a few eggs.
20043	Allowing the dinosaurs fight one another is controversial, and I understand why. I’m not unsympathetic. But this is how nature intended it. If we don't let them act on their instincts these animals will act on them in other, more destructive and dangerous ways. See that it is done.
20044	Personally, I think this is insanity and more risk than I’m comfortable with, but the powers that be think permitting the dinosaurs to fight allows them to better evaluate their capabilities. At least, let’s see what we can learn as well.
20045	I don’t want to call this entertainment exactly, but having dinosaurs face each other in primal combat? Well, there’s enough truth in that to make it palatable.
20046	Mo’ dinos, mo’ money. That’s my mo’... ah, motto.
20047	Great... more dinosaurs. More ways for things to go wrong. Like who could predict that?
20048	The more space we develop, the more dinosaurs we need to keep things... interesting.
20049	More dinosaurs means more potential problems we have to keep an eye on. Vigilance is the name of the game.
20050	The park is doing so well, I think we can expand. More dinosaurs should do the trick.
20051	Hard to believe, but people quickly come to see the dinosaurs as old hat. They want “special” with their “improbable”. So let’s get our Dinosaur Ratings up, and shut ‘em up... while their mouths hang wide open.
20052	I've created a variety of spectacular animals. I want you to ensure they are seen. This will improve our dinosaur rating. See to it.
20053	Let’s get our Dinosaur Rating up. We have a show to put on, and they are the stars.
20054	You do know what would be brilliant, don’t you? A higher Dinosaur Rating. And a cheese and onion pie. I’ve been craving one for ages and there’s nowhere close by to get one.
20055	Word is there are dinosaurs that need our help. So here’s the word... go help them.
20056	Rescuing dinosaurs is the main reason I’m here. I know you feel the same way. So let’s do what we can, okay?
20057	When dinosaurs are outside of our control and protection, they serve no purpose other than as threats to our entire operation. Call it rescue, or capture... honestly, I don’t care. But get them back where they belong.
20058	When we bring a dinosaur into our world, it becomes our responsibility. That means we have to do what we can to rescue these animals when things go wrong. Today, we must be our best.
20059	We’ve rescued the dinosaurs, but they can’t stay out there... not in the wild. We need them housed securely within their enclosures.
20060	Spend enough time around any animal and you begin to understand its behaviors.. what motivates it. That's why I first started training Blue... so we could gain a better understanding of the raptors. And because it was cool. I mean, come on.
20061	What’s the point of having dinosaurs if we can’t keep them healthy and disease free? I’m not really asking... you and I both know the answer.
20062	I can make them, but you must maintain them.
20063	While you could argue that these animals are living experiments, they are still deserving of the best care we can provide. Healthy specimens, if you will, make for better science.
20064	Hopefully, the healthier the dinosaurs are, the less likely we’ll have behavioral issues, like breakouts. Content dinosaurs are the kind we can manage.
20065	Disease-free dinosaurs is our goal Not some, but all. Difficult, but not impossible. As you’ll soon prove.
20066	While we’ve worked with less in the past, for this particular dinosaur, we’ll need a genome that hits the target.
20067	The genomes we’ve been able to unlock form the very foundations of paleo-genetics. We need as much of this current one as possible. Don’t report back until you’ve been successful.
20068	This genome should prove incredibly valuable to our research. Make sure the scientists have it.
20069	We’re looking to have a complete genome for this species. And with your efforts, we’re making great strides toward achieving that goal.
20070	Here’s our target genome for this species. I’m sure you’ll rise to the challenge.
20071	We want the park to be as comfortable as home is for our guests. Okay, maybe it’s louder. And they need to keep the doors locked, but you get my point, right?
20072	When the guests are comfortable, they’re happy. Which means they’re more likely to share this one of a kind experience with others. And that means more resources to ensure the dinosaurs are cared for. Which makes me happy.
20073	When the guests are comfortable, they’re happy. Which means they’re more likely to share this one of a kind experience with others. That means more resources to ensure the dinosaurs are cared for which is always the priority.
20074	Guest comfort must be a priority. What good is a park full of wonders if no one wants to visit?
20075	Look, happy guests are repeat customers. Let’s keep them as comfortable as possible.
20076	Who doesn’t like to feel cozy and comfy? Our guests want to be pampered while they’re being amazed and terrified. See what you can do.
20077	You can measure our success by our head count. Especially the ones that are still attached at the neck. So let’s strive for that.
20078	The more we share our animals with the world, the more accepted they become, and by extension, the more our work enters the mainstream.
20079	More people in the park means more opportunities for things to go sideways. Our posture should be proactive. If we’re reacting, we’re already too late.
20080	The more guests we can get into the park, the more people we convert into dinosaur fans. And the only place they can see and visit them for real is right here.
20081	Living dinosaurs should be enough to have the world beat a path to our door. But we can do better.
20082	Like a T. rex, we need fresh meat. In the form of new staff, I mean.
20083	We can always use an extra pair of hands. As the park grows, so does our need for more staff. Let’s hire some.
20084	When it comes to keeping these animals in check, the more personnel we have, the better.
20085	We can’t get caught short-handed. That’s when things can go off the rails. Hire the people we need to keep things running smoothly.
20086	We could use some more personnel. Maybe a career day or job fair... whatever it takes. Hire away.
20087	Hey, you know what’s better than dinosaurs? More dinosaurs. Or so they tell me. Let’s incubate and release some more and see what happens. And... if anything goes wrong, we never had this little talk, comprende?
20088	A sustainable population... that’s one of the fundamental pillars of nature. The same holds true in the park. That’s why we need to incubate this dinosaur and get it released into an enclosure.
20089	A sustainable population... that’s one of the fundamental pillars of nature. The same holds true in the park. That’s why we need to incubate this animal and get it released into an enclosure.
20090	My research is on-going. Regardless of what has been discovered, there is always more to learn. There’s an asset here for you to incubate and release. We are on schedule, let's keep it that way.
20091	I’m uploading information on a new incubation plan I’d like you to focus on. Once they’re ready for release, introduce them into the park.
20092	I’m always excited to see a new addition to the park. It’s like Christmas morning... but Santa has fangs.
20093	The Park Rating could be higher, and I’d hate to think I failed in getting you to work harder.
20094	The park is really coming together, but we can always do more. It would be terrific if you could get our Park Rating up.
20095	A higher Park Rating improves everything. Strive for excellence and reap the rewards.
20096	If we can get the Park Rating up, that should improve things across the board. Make sure to stay on top of it.
20097	The Park Rating is looking good, but it could be looking better.
20098	You’d think dinosaurs would be enough. But we have competition. Look, it’s a raptor eat raptor world now, so we need to do everything we can to get our Park Rating on an upward trajectory. That’s a measure of our success in paleo-entertainment.
20099	Safety is my primary concern. My safety, primarily.
20100	When things go wrong at the park, they can really go wrong. That’s not something I ever want to live through again, thank you very much. And we avoid... issues... by paying attention to park safety. So I hope you are paying attention to it.
20101	Safety should be our priority. The last thing we need is a swarm of lawyers sifting through our work or hiding in the bushes. Hmmm... who knows what might be lurking out there...
20102	We are the line that determines whether this show... this entire endeavor.. is fortune or tragedy. Our Park Safety Rating will reflect that.
20103	Safety is no joke. When things go wrong around these animals, it’s no laughing matter.
20104	I hope you’re good at taking pictures, because we need some. Just point the camera at the dinosaurs and say “goat cheese”.
20105	The scientists are extremely interested in documenting certain behaviors.. and photographic evidence is part of their plan. I’ve seen some of your photos, and I can’t think of anyone better to help.
20106	Here’s a chance to show off your artistic side. The scientist need to get some specific imagery, and they’d like you to take the photos.
20107	I’m thinking we should have a contest to see if can get certain dinosaurs together in one photo, and I’d like you to prove it’s possible.
20108	We need some dinosaur photos, so snap to it...
20109	The team's interested in this particular item and we can help them with the research.
20110	The unknown... it’s what motivates me to push harder everyday. Obstacles are intellectual puzzles to be conquered. Research can lead the way.
20111	This is something that our team could really use, so I want you to figure it out.
20112	Research could prove to be a real lifesaver. For us, for the dinosaurs, and for the park.
20113	The more tools we have at our disposal, the more ways we can get into trouble. Out… out, out of trouble.
20114	Who doesn’t like working for me? I’m not being rhetorical, we have to keep people from leaving. Thankfully, you’re loyal, so start convincing everyone else.
20115	In addition to all of the normal pressures of work, we have the added intensity of dealing with the dinosaurs. Even the herbivores can be a handful. The pressure can be intense. So focus on doing what you can to keep the staff content. We want to retain our skilled workers.
20116	If people run for the helicopters every time something goes pear-shaped, then this place will soon be a ghost-town overrun with spirits from the past. Spirits with teeth. Let’s make sure to avoid that. Keep our staffing levels up.
20117	I don’t think anyone would argue that working with the dinosaurs isn’t stressful. But that’s show business. Even if it is from sixty-five million years ago. We can’t have people turning in pink slips because they saw a little red.
20118	Right. It can be hard to hang onto staff when dinosaurs are the job. A risk we take to be on the cutting edge. But we can’t have our work force walking out... or running out either.
20119	Before I was a dinosaur person, I was a people person, and I still am. And that’s why I believe it’s our responsibility to pass on what we’ve learned.
20120	We need to have staff at your level of competence. Or better. You may be training your replacement. That’s entirely up to you.
20121	Here’s your chance to train some new staff. Make sure they not only have the skills, but the passion needed, to care for the dinosaurs.
20122	We want exceptional staff working in the park... no exceptions.
20123	Training our staff how to do their jobs better is a win for the entire operation. Get on top of it.
20124	"We’re in the paleo-curation business, sure. But people only hear that “paleo” part. However, it’s that second ""business"" part that’s really at our core. Talk about the real survival of the fittest."
20125	Of course I’m interested in the value of paleontology. Before me, the science toiled in relative obscurity. But since I created living dinosaurs? Doing the impossible requires a level of excellence you can only retain if you compensate accordingly.
20126	I’m more interested in knowledge than the creature comforts that come with wealth, but there is no denying that the park is a business. So we have to be aware of the bottom line.
20127	I do this because I love the craft... but a little extra in the bank doesn’t hurt.
20128	Money makes the world go ‘round. The more resources we have at our disposal, the more we can do for the dinosaurs.
20129	We need to do what we can for the dinosaurs... like taking on objectives. This one, for example.
20130	Every step forward improves the lives of the dinosaurs. This latest objective is another one of those critical steps. You should read about it when you get a chance.
20131	Sometimes, when I feel overwhelmed, I remind myself that we are leading the way forward to a future with prehistoric animals. Crazy, right? That’s why taking on objectives like this one should be a no-brainer.
20132	This next objective should be perfect for you. I think you'll feel the same when you take a look at it.
20133	Here’s one that I think will interest you. I’m sending over the details now.
20134	Okay, I’ve got a new objective for you to look over.
20135	If you want something done right, you do it yourself. Or at least delegate it to someone you trust. In this case, that's you. Check out this latest objective.
20136	Here’s an objective you should definitely take a moment to review.
20137	Anything for the dinosaurs, right? Like this next objective.
20138	I wouldn’t trust this next objective to anyone else. Well, maybe Owen Grady. With lots of supervision. But you should be able to handle this on your own.
20139	Okay... okay. We’re making progress. But there’s always more to be done. For you anyway. Take this next objective, for example.
20140	Where I step out, you step in. I’ve done my part by introducing you to the latest objective. Now you do yours.
20141	Most people have no idea of what’s involved in caring for the dinosaurs. Check out this latest objective and you’ll see what I mean.
20142	I like to think of myself as a behind-the-scenes hero. Money and logistics make the world go round. Especially when we are talking about the park.
20143	Prove you have what it takes and review this latest objective.
20144	I didn’t get where I am without knowing how to delegate work to others. Like I’m doing now with this new objective. All yours.
20145	Check out this latest objective.
20146	Do you like to read? Are you ready for something new? Then this objective is right up your alley.
20147	I was in touch with my lizard brain long before I started working with dinosaurs. Fear, rage, fight, flight... every new challenge is an opportunity to explore them all. Well, maybe not this latest objective. Or... I’ll let you decide.
20148	Read up on this new objective and then let me know you’re going to do it.
20149	Carpe diem. Seize the day. That’s my motto. It should be yours as well. This new objective, for instance, is just ripe for the taking.
20150	Let’s team-up on this next objective. You do the work, I’ll take the credit. That’s a win for us both.
20151	What would it take to get you interested in this next objective? I’m not above begging.
20152	Another objective is available. Unlike me.
20153	I’ve just sent the details of the latest objective. Read ‘em and weep... tears of joy that I’ve chosen you for this one.
20154	Not everyone can do this. But I think you can. Check out this objective. And don’t disappoint.
20155	I’d jump on this newest objective, but my job is to make sure folks like you do the work instead.
20156	You should be able to manage this next objective. As a manager myself, I have a pretty good sense about these things.
20157	When you break it down, dinosaurs are really just assets... not that different from any other business. Well, except for the biting and the other unpleasantness. Still, they do present plenty of opportunities. This next objective, for instance.
20158	Even I could do this next job, which means you should be able to as well. Read up on the details of the objective, and then, chop-chop. Or chomp-chomp. Get it?
20159	When the dinosaurs are in the enclosures and behaving, they’re not my problem. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. This latest objective can help our work. Read up on it. Do what you can.
20160	Attention to detail can be the difference between life and death. Review this new objective and sweat the small stuff.
20161	Trust is a big part of the job. That’s why I trust you’ll take on this latest objective and see it through.
20162	Knowledge is power. This next objective should increase our knowledge, which gives us an edge. The rest? That’s for you to figure out.
20163	I have a new assignment for you to review.
20164	Another objective has just landed. I’ve shared the details with you.
20165	This next objective is challenging, but you should be up to it. Only one way to know for sure, however. Your decision.
20166	The first time I stared down the maw of an angry T. rex, I knew nothing would ever be the same. And that I need to always be learning, because these animals damn sure are. That’s where this latest objective comes in. The more we know, the better prepared we can be.
20167	This next objective is important. Treat it as such.
20168	The dinosaurs aren’t our biggest threat, ignorance is. Mistakes happen when we don’t have enough knowledge or understanding. That’s why objectives like this latest one are so critically important.
20169	I don’t want you to do a good job on this next objective, I need you to.
20170	Observation is a key skill-set in the security business. In case you’re wondering if I’ll be keeping an eye on you as you deal with this new objective, that would be an affirmative.
20171	I’ve got a new objective I need you to tackle.
20172	I want our stance to be proactive, not reactive. That means staying on top of these objectives. I’ve sent you details on the latest.
20173	Everything has merit. You’d be surprised at how often the most important detail is overlooked. That’s why I want you to really go over the briefing material on this latest objective.
20174	I’m confident you can handle this next objective. Don’t prove me wrong.
20175	We can’t afford to make mistakes, because one is all that it takes for a carnivore to make you just another meal. I want you to take this next objective with the same level of seriousness. Lives may depend on it.
20176	Another assignment is coming in hot.
20177	We’ve been tasked with another objective and I’d like you to spearhead the effort.
20178	Here at the park, we’re dealing with the biggest of game. The most dangerous. Unpredictable. And unforgiving. Are we intimidated? Not in the least. Take this next objective... we’re just the team to do it. I’ve shared the details with you. Read it ASAP.
20179	There’s a new objective. I’m expecting you to get on it immediately. I’ve sent the details for you to review.
20180	My work is on-going. It requires constant updates and information. That’s why the latest objective is important to me. And why it should be important to you.
20181	I’m going to get right to the point. There’s another objective available. Get it done.
20182	I do not suffer fools gladly, or for that matter, at all. Prove to me that I was correct in sharing this latest objective with you.
20183	No one believed in my research at first. Until we had viable embryos, and living dinosaurs. Then, suddenly everyone is looking to turn a profit off the science. My science. So you can understand why I share information so cautiously. Like this latest objective. I’d hate to find out my trust in you is misplaced.
20184	I’ll make this short and direct. There is a new objective I’d like to see you complete. Review the details I’ve sent and then get to it.
20185	You’ve been capable up to this point. Let’s see if that continues with this latest objective.
20186	Understand what we are up against. The world wants to exploit us or shut us down. These are the extremes we face. That’s why we stay focused on the job at hand. Add this new objective to the list.
20187	Wanting what’s best for the dinosaurs and what’s best for me should not be mutually exclusive. For instance, this recently added objective can be good for us all.
20188	I need people who can do the job as directed. I’ve put the latest objective details into a message for you to review. Pay attention and get it done as instructed.
20189	Some have said that creating the dinosaurs was easy, it’s living with them that has proven to be difficult. I say that anyone who thinks what I’ve accomplished is easy is welcome to try it. Maybe you’d like to try your hand at it, but for now, focus on this new objective.
20190	Here’s something that should be of interest to you. The details are on your screen.
20191	This one is way too good to pass up. After you check it out, I think you’ll agree.
20192	I’ve got something for you to do. Give it a once over.
20193	This objective has a little something for everyone. But mostly for you. Read it when you get a chance.
20194	Opportunity is at the door. Can you hear it knocking? I can.
20195	This job has got your name all over it. Because that’s who it’s addressed to.
20196	There’s always something that needs doing around here, like this opportunity that’s just being offered. You’d do well to check it out.
20197	I’ve got a new objective. This one should interest you.
20198	Another day, another opportunity for greatness. This objective? Oh, this one’s good. Read the details and I think you’ll agree.
20199	Keep up the good work. And check out this new objective when you get a chance.
20200	If there’s one thing I hate, it’s a missed opportunity. Hopefully, you feel the same way and will take a look at this latest assignment.
20201	Our plate may be full, but there’s always room for more. Read up on this next objective. Unlike the dinosaurs, I want you to stay hungry.
20202	New objective inbound. This one’s a winner.
20203	If you want more, that’s what I’ve got. More challenges in the form of a new objective.
20204	Read up on this next objective. You’ll want to get this one into the finished column.
20205	Hey, I’ve got another mission for you. Read the details.
20206	This next objective is a good one. Definitely take a look.
20207	I’m confident you’re gonna want to check out this latest objective. I’m sending the details now.
20208	I hope you’re good to go, because this objective is too good to pass up.
20209	I’d do this one myself, but I think you can handle it. Read the objective and see if you don’t agree.
20210	Well, it looks like we find ourselves with another objective. Could be interesting. And important, obviously. But will you take it? That is the unknown. You, my friend, you are the chaos.
20211	Yes, there is a new objective that you should review. And then act on. I mean, what good is information without application?
20212	I’m sure you’re busy... aren’t we all... but this latest objective is something that you should really pay attention to.
20213	If only we had more time. Interestingly, that’s really what we’ve given to the dinosaurs, isn’t it? More time.
20214	Oh, I see you have a new objective. Read it, won’t you?
20215	In science, a big part of the process is in knowing which questions to explore, and which ones to leave alone. But there’s no question this new objective is the exploring kind.
20216	We’d like to believe we have some control over our fate, but the truth is, none of us knows what is going to happen in the next second of our existence. We live on the precipice. It makes things interesting, though, doesn’t it? This new objective appears it would yield good things. And I’m rarely wrong.
20217	Look what we have here... another objective for you to complete.
20218	The first time I saw a dinosaur, I was both amazed and concerned. Nothing since that moment has changed. These animals are a testament to humanity’s brilliance and to its hubris. But they are among us now, so the more we know, the better. This latest objective is part of that knowledge. It would be a shame to see it lost.
20219	People think chaos is random, but in truth, it is deterministic. We just don’t see the underlying patterns. We don’t know where to look. And just as importantly, when to look. And that’s it, isn’t it? The real miracle of the dinosaurs is not that they’re here... they’ve been here before... it’s that they’re here now.
20220	I’ll get right to it. There’s a new objective you need to review. Details forthcoming.
20221	I want us to keep our focus on getting these objectives accomplished. Read up on this latest one.
20222	Risk vs. reward. That is the eternal debate. However, with this objective, the reward is high and the risk is low. Review the details and then get to it.
20223	Our science is on-going. This newest objective should help us better understand the dinosaurs. That’s why I expect you to complete it.
20224	Please review this next objective. It should prove helpful to our mission.
20225	I’m sending you information on another objective.
20226	I’m giving you an interesting objective. Only a fool would pass this one up. And I don’t think you are a fool. Prove me right.
20227	Read the details of this latest objective. It’s perfect for you...
20228	I like this next objective. I think you will too.
20229	You will definitely want to do this next objective. Trust me, I’m a doctor.
20230	There's another objective waiting for you. That's all I'm allowed to share at the moment. I'll check back later to see how you're getting on.
20231	The more objectives you take on, the more experience you gain in our chosen field of paleo-curation This one is a good example.
20232	I’m counting on you to handle this next objective. Don’t let me down.
20233	Read this next objective, and I trust you’ll want to complete it.
20234	Science is about seeking knowledge. The more objectives you successfully accomplish, the better our understanding of the dinosaurs. And I learn something about you as well.
20235	I will accept nothing less than your best. This next objective should give you the chance to prove what you’re capable of... to me, and to yourself.
20236	Read up on this next objective. It should be one you can handle.
20237	It’s the little things that keep the big things the way we want them. This next objective falls squarely into that category.
20238	I’ve sent the details on another objective I’d like you to take on. I believe you can get it done to my satisfaction.
20239	It's really exciting that you’re able to help out with these objectives. I’ve sent along the details for you to review.
20240	I’m confident that you’ll find this latest objective to your liking.
20241	This next objective could be a challenge, but I have every confidence you’ll see it through.
20242	Seriously, this next objective is worth your time. I’ve sent you written details.
20243	Working with the dinosaurs is such a treat. We keep things running smoothly, and it should stay that way. That’s why you’ll want to get on this next objective straight away.
20244	If you had told me when I was in business school that one day my business would be dinosaurs, I’d have thought you mad. Yet, here we are. With another objective to boot. And I don’t mean in the backside.
20245	I wanted to bring this latest objective to you straightaway. Read it and you’ll see why.
20246	You and I make quite the team. Together, we should be able to accomplish this next objective sharpish.
20247	I’m ready. You should be as well. If so, then this next objective is as good as done.
20248	I’m looking at another objective, and you are the ideal candidate to see it completed.
20249	I’ve just uploaded the latest objective for your review. Have a look, won’t you?
20250	It may seem like our work is never done, but each new objective gets us ever closer to our ultimate goal... truly understanding the dinosaurs. That’s why this next objective is just as important as all the others.
20251	This is a task I absolutely know you can finish. That’s why I’m sharing it with you.
20252	We all want what’s best, for the dinosaurs and for each other. Well, correction, I have my doubts about some, but not you. You’re all right. Maybe even better than. This next objective will prove that even more. Read up on it, will you?
20253	Quick update. Another objective is available.
20254	I’ve got another objective that should pique your interest.
20255	I just wanted to say how much I value all of your contributions. What you are doing for the dinosaurs is nothing short of spectacular. Also, we have another objective, but don’t let my previous words influence your decision in any way. Well, okay, maybe a little.
20256	Together, we are moving mountains. Or at least large, stubborn animals from millions of years ago. So this next objective should be easy peasy.
20257	This next objective is important, so let’s not mess it up.
20258	Every time something goes wrong and one of our guests or dinosaurs is hurt... or worse... I’m absolutely gutted. Knowing as much as we can helps mitigate these moments. That’s why this next objective is so important. It adds to our knowledge base.
20259	Hey, take a take a look at this next objective. I mean, I’d do it, but I have you.
20260	I really like this next objective and I will like it even more if you complete it.
20261	Raptors have learned how to work together to take down their prey. So how bout me and you work together to take down this objective.
20262	Don’t say I never gave you anything... here’s an opportunity you’re not gonna want to miss.
20263	There’s a new objective. I’m sending you the details now.
20264	Claire once told me to pay attention to the details. I guess if you, the rest will sort itself out. That’s good advice to think about as you look at this next objective.
20265	I’ve got my hands full with the dinosaurs, so I’m leaving this next objective to you.
20266	Okay, this is how I see this going down. I tell you about this objective, then you complete it. Which means that as of this moment, my part is done.
20267	There’s another objective and it's coming in hot.
20268	"If we are going to have a world where the dinosaurs can coexist with humans, then we need as much info as possible. That’s why this next objective is so important. Like, totally ""mission critical""."
20269	Wow... just wow, I knew you could do it. And now you have.
20270	When I first started working with the dinosaurs, I was super overwhelmed. But you’re making it look easy.
20271	You dealt with that last objective like a true professional. You should be proud.
20272	I’m glad to see you care as much about getting these missions accomplished as you do about the dinosaurs. I mean, they do go hand in hand.
20273	When the shock of seeing living dinosaurs wears off, then you're left with the difficult task of taking care of them. Completing objectives like that last one is part of what makes it work.
20274	The way you dealt with that last objective... that was perfect. You stayed focused and saw it through. If only we had more people like you around.
20275	Ask some folks around here to do things, and it can be hit or miss. But that last objective? Way to go.
20276	Taking care of these animals, it’s not just about the dinosaurs...it's about how we evolve ourselves now that they're back. Truth is, we’re constantly learning about them, and about us. That objective you just completed adds to our understanding. That can only be a good thing. Thank you.
20277	I just wanted to say “thank you” for taking care of that last objective. You're pretty awesome. At this rate, it won’t be long before you’re running the place. In fact, it kinda feels like you are already.
20278	Remember, there is no “I” in team, but there is one in “Cabot Finch”. So in a sense, I’m helping, and your success is my success.
20279	We’ve still got a lot to do, and by “we” I mean “you”, but at this pace, you’ll soon be getting nothing but praise. And by “you’ll” I mean “we’ll”.
20280	That’s a gold star for you, and another thing off my list for me.
20281	I’m going to point out that you’ve done yeoman's work on this latest objective, but don’t let it go to your head. The last thing we need around here is an arrogant blowhard.
20282	Few realize that I was here at the beginning. Hammond, InGen, Isla Nublar... all me. I had a hand. And I kept it. Now I find myself praising the work of others, like you. Still, it keeps me in the game.
20283	You’ve done the job and done it well. There... what more do you want?
20284	I wasn’t certain you’d be able to tackle that last objective, but you’ve proved me wrong. Either way, it's a win for me.
20285	Job done, I’d say. And I guess I have.
20286	You’re making tremendous strides. This last objective being a perfect example. And I suspect you’re gaining interest from the higher-ups. Just remember who’s in charge. And if you do remember, can you share it with me?
20287	You’ve put your organization skills to excellent use dealing with that job. Reminds me of my ex. She used to constantly remind me to be more organized. The lesson stuck with me... she didn’t.
20288	You did it, I did it... who’s keeping score?
20289	The dinosaur business, like any other, can be a killer. Maybe more literal for us. That’s why we celebrate each success. So, cheers.
20290	That objective didn’t stand a chance once I got you involved. We make a heck of a duo, if I do say so myself.
20291	Set ‘em up and knock ‘em down. That's the way you take on these objectives. I feel like my excellence is rubbing off on you. Or maybe that’s my cologne.
20292	I’ve always strived to be the best. That’s my motto. And have someone to blame when you’re not. That’s just smart planning. Getting ahead of the problem by figuring out your excuse in advance. But with this last objective, you can put all that aside, because, hurrah, you did it.
20293	I like the dinosaurs... I do. I like them just fine. Except the smell. But I like what they can do for our bottom line even more. That’s why I like you. You’re delivering. And I don’t have to smell you either.
20294	I feel like we’ve reached an understanding. You understand you need to complete these missions, and I understand that you need to complete these missions. Win, win.
20295	I guess congratulations are in order. So let me see if I can order some.
20296	Sounds like we have good news... this latest objective is finished. That feeling you have? The satisfaction of a job well done. Never gets boring, I tell ya.
20297	You were like an Indoraptor with glasses, hunting down that objective. Assuming you wear glasses. Do you? Don’t answer...
20298	You’re proving yourself to be a valuable asset.
20299	Security is about attention to detail. Something you clearly understand.
20300	Excellent work on that last objective. I expect we’ll see some positive dividends as a result.
20301	We wrangle dinosaurs daily, so how tough could that mission have been, really?
20302	That objective is completely squared away. Outstanding.
20303	Our job is to remain ever vigilant. Because we know the dinosaurs will give no quarter. Taking care of that objective only helps us accomplish the mission.
20304	We are the bold. We take risks, because there is no substitute for experience.
20305	Courage comes with the job. That and dedication. You’ve got both.
20306	On that last objective, you were directly over the target.
20307	There is a line between the dinosaurs as a wonder, and the dinosaurs as a terror. And we are that line.
20308	Successfully executing a mission relies on preparation. The same holds true for securing the dinosaurs. Based on the last objective, I’d say you’ve got the necessary skill-set.
20309	Hey, we get all this and a pay check too.
20310	Let’s face it, this place is the ultimate dog and pony show. Only the acts can swallow you whole. You’re doing a good job of keeping that from happening. Keep at it.
20311	Okay, good job, let's keep our heads down and keep on like this.
20312	There’s an art to getting other people to get things done. Some call that leadership. You have the quality.
20313	I don’t care about the credit, I care about the results. I’m glad you feel the same way.
20314	When it comes to the dinosaurs, we know the right thing to do. The question is, are we willing to do it? With this last objective, you’ve erased that doubt.
20315	We learn from our failures. But here, in the park, they can be expensive. And deadly. That’s why it’s critically important you continue to excel. Lives depend on it.
20316	I'd gladly welcome all the sweat of getting things right, rather than have the blood of getting it wrong. It’s good to know you’re with me on this.
20317	Great things, like these dinosaurs, they don’t happen from places of comfort. I see and appreciate what you’re doing. We accept that danger comes with the territory. Let’s make sure we keep it there.
20318	I expect you to do your job. But I'm surprised you did it so well.
20319	With this latest objective accomplished, my science can move forward. You’ll be hearing more from me shortly. Be prepared.
20320	The dinosaurs are my primary concern. They are the future engineered from the past. You are helping to make that happen. Remember that.
20321	I had my doubts, as I often do, but you have yet to let me down. Not bad.
20322	Don’t think that because I don’t comment on every action, I’m not tracking your performance. If you weren’t performing to an acceptable standard, you would know it. I’d make sure of it.
20323	I only have room for the best when it comes to my team. The fact that you’re still here should tell you something.
20324	I’m not above expressing gratitude if it’s in order. The last objective meets that standard. Thank you.
20325	I’m not working for accolades... not yet. Legacy comes much later. For now, we need to understand as much as we can about the dinosaurs if they are to be a viable commodity. So continue your efforts. People care for what they value.
20326	My life’s work is tied up in these dinosaurs. So if I’m not giving you my full attention, you know why. However, I hear you are doing well, and successfully taking on tasks and completing missions. This can lead to greater things for you.
20327	I’ll make this short and semi-sweet: your work is essential to our mission, and so far, you appear to be successfully meeting your goals. It has been noted.
20328	Great work. That’s how you get it done.
20329	I knew I picked the right person for the job.
20330	Outstanding. Let’s call this one complete.
20331	Stellar work on that last assignment.
20332	Okay, you done good.
20333	I hear congratulations are in order. Way to see that objective through to the end.
20334	I wasn’t the least bit concerned you’d be able to handle that objective. Turns out I was right. Well done.
20335	Success has a feeling all of its own, and you should be feeling it right about now.
20336	Okay, let’s check this objective off the list. Nice work.
20337	The dinosaurs need competent people who will get the job done. People like you. Keep it up.
20338	The objective is always to complete the objective. And that’s what you’ve done.
20339	You better give yourself a pat on the back. You’ve earned it.
20340	Now, I’ve been monitoring your progress and I like what I see. That last objective was a challenge, but you handled it with authority.
20341	That roar you hear isn’t a T. rex, but a cheer for your dedication and hard work in completing that objective. Okay, maybe it is a T. rex, but my appreciation still remains.
20342	Wow, that last objective wasn’t easy, but you made it look like a piece of cake. I’m impressed.
20343	Boom. That’s another objective down. You’re really making a name for yourself.
20344	I have it on good authority that you’ve wrapped up your latest objective. Way to stay on task.
20345	It’s clear from the way you dealt with that last objective that we’re lucky to have you around.
20346	Finishing up this most recent objective is really a credit to your dedication.
20347	You know, people don’t understand all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes. But you and I both know it. And completing that objective... well that keeps things running as they should. It can be a thankless job, I know. But not today. Thanks.
20348	Well, this certainly looks like good news. An objective complete. Lessons learned. Knowledge gained. Preconceptions challenged. Or perhaps, you’ve just figured out a more efficient distribution for popcorn. Who can say?
20349	It is wrong to associate chaos with an upheaval in plans. Chaos was the plan all along. Consider this as you accomplish these missions.
20350	To say I have a strange relationship with the dinosaurs would be an understatement. I almost lost my life to some. And to others, I owe it. Yet still I doubt people’s intentions. But I trust you. Don’t make me regret that.
20351	If I have an objection regarding the science at play, it is that it’s entirely unearned. So many shortcuts were taken because the entire endeavor was both a push for dinosaurs and a push for dollars. One caused the other to take risks that could not be fully mitigated, and well, the results... well, the creations turned on, and ate, their creators. Not an optimal result.
20352	You’re impressing the right folks around this place. Take from that what you will, but watch your back. The predators here are not just in the bushes.
20353	This place... these dinosaurs, it’s all truly a dream. And now you’re helping to expand that fantasy. But can we really co-exist with prehistoric creatures genetically-modified and gene-spliced back into existence? Only time will tell. Well, I could make a highly-educated guess. But why spoil the fun?
20354	You did it... you did it.
20355	I speak only for myself, but this place is lucky to have you around. You have hope and optimism tempered by the realization that it is not a question of “if”, but of “when”, history repeats itself. The irony of trying to control chaos when we know how history played out isn't lost on me.
20356	I've heard you continue to do well and are helping make real progress. I suppose you should be congratulated? But I’ve seen this before. So you also have my warnings. You really aren't seeing what is being accomplished in the name of science. The genie can’t be put back in the bottle. And if you try, it’ll take your head off.
20357	Time separated us for a reason. The dinosaurs used to belong here. This was their planet. But that was then, not now. So the question is will time accept what this science is attempting... a resetting of the geological clock... the timeline that was a stable predictor of the world’s progression? I don’t know, but it sure is exciting to have a front row seat, isn’t it?
20358	The science... it’s everything. And we’ll take our victories where we can find them. Nice job.
20359	Sometimes, it is important to take a minute and reflect on what we are doing. Baby steps can be just as important as giant leaps. It’s too soon to know which category this latest objective falls into, but that is one of the wonders of our work. The unknown.
20360	It is such a privilege to spend our days, and our nights, bringing these amazing animals back and sharing them with the world. That should be thanks enough.
20361	You’ve done well, and I expect you to continue down this path. You are becoming a valuable asset.
20362	I’ve just reviewed the data, and can confirm that the objective is complete. For this, you have my gratitude.
20363	The dinosaurs capture one’s imagination. And we continue to capture information with the completion of work, such as this latest objective. That is a feather in your cap.
20364	You continue to accomplish great things.
20365	I wish I could share with you all that I know, but some elements of my work must remain a mystery. However, your achievements are no secret. So “well done” to you.
20366	My compliments on your recent success with that objective.
20367	Not everyone approves of what we’re doing with the dinosaurs. I mark this down to fear... mostly of the unknown. That’s why our work is so important. We need to create the conditions necessary for the dinosaurs’ survival. For that we must have champions. And you are quickly becoming one.
20368	Sincere felicitations on your latest accomplishment.
20369	While I understand that some of these objectives are difficult, the rewards of seeing them through to the end are many.
20370	Sometimes I wonder if the younger me would believe what the current me is doing. While pride can be ugly, it can also motivate us to greatness. And that is where we are headed. Or perhaps, we have already arrived.
20371	I fully endorse your work ethic. It very much reminds me of my own.
20372	My team is reporting that the job is done. I expected no less. And I’m pleased to see that my expectations have been met.
20373	There will come a time when we reflect on what we’ve been able to accomplish with the dinosaurs, but for now, we must stay intently focused on the challenges before us. Every success matters.
20374	Of course I understand that the dinosaurs have “entertainment” value. They are the ultimate curiosity. Still, I won’t have them treated as sideshow exhibits. They are wonders of science. Our wonders.
20375	As we discover more about the dinosaurs, we discover more about ourselves. You’ve played a crucial role in that revelation by completing these objectives. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed.
20376	Well done. Continue along this path, and you're sure to impress someone. Perhaps even me.
20377	As you might have guessed by now, there are plans for the dinosaurs that only a select few know. Even though you are doing well, for now, you must remain out of that loop. I hope you understand. And if you don’t, so be it.
20378	Change is coming, and you’ve helped to facilitate it with your excellent work.
20379	I just wanted to pop in and let you know how much all of us appreciate your efforts.
20380	Smashing work. Keep it up.
20381	Your work on that last objective was spot on. Truly inspiring.
20382	How you completed that objective... it was absolutely blinding.
20383	I’m seeing reports that you’ve really taken to the job. That's brilliant.
20384	The first time I felt the breath of a dinosaur, I was gobsmacked. Nothing since then has really surprised or shocked me. Still, you seem capable... what with all the objectives you’re finishing.
20385	You’re keeping things running smoothly on your end, which makes things much easier on mine. That’s great.
20386	I was worried there for a moment, but you pulled through on that last objective. Nice one, really.
20387	On this mission, you did a proper job, and we all noticed.
20388	The way you’ve been approaching these objectives is most impressive.
20389	Most people would look at an objective like this and throw their hands up in the air. But you... you put your head down and got to it. That’s the kind of fortitude we could use more of around here.
20390	Thanks for getting that objective all tidied up. That’s it for now. I’ll let you crack on.
20391	The latest news looks very good, and I think we owe at least some of that to you.
20392	With all the moving parts around this place... including the dinosaurs, it’s a wonder we get anything done. Fortunately, we have people like you, so that’s not a concern.
20393	I wish we could do more for the dinosaurs, but we do what we can, and in your case, we do it well.
20394	I don’t know what we’d do without you. And I have no desire to find out.
20395	Well done, you.
20396	I think of this place... the park... it’s about dreams, more than dinosaurs, actually. A vision of what is possible. And you are a part of that.
20397	When one of us succeeds, we all succeed. At least, that’s what John Hammond told me.
20398	Watching you work... well, it is a sight to behold. I’m knackered after a few phone calls, but you just go on, and on, and on. Where do you get the energy?
20399	"Way I see it, you sometimes have to be willing to at least bend the rules to get anything done around here. But you seem to be able to work within the system. Take this latest objective. You nailed it. And didn’t even have to requisition a hammer. ""Hammer""..."
20400	Here’s a bit of advice based on my early experience training raptors: don’t stand between them and what they want. I’m getting the same vibes from you and that last objective.
20401	Hey, you’ve got that objective all wrapped-up. This is me giving you a high-five.
20402	You may not know this, but I’ve seen some serious stuff during my time with the dinosaurs. Claire and I, we’ve had our share of close calls. But your work on that objective, that wasn’t a close call, that was a slam dunk.
20403	I know what it feels like to have people assume you can’t do something. But you and I, we continue to prove them wrong.
20404	The way I see it, there are dog people, and cat people. And then there’s a raptor person. Me. Does that make me special? Probably. Anyway, you can learn a lot from me. Like how to deal with your latest objective success.
20405	Dedication, and having nerves of steel... they’re the keys to working with the dinosaurs. And trust. That's what we have, and that’s why I knew you’d be able to handle that last objective. And you did.
20406	You can out-smart the dinosaurs, or you can out-run the dinosaurs, and after that, your options are pretty limited. But watching you handle that last objective, well that was, like, art. Okay, maybe I’m laying it on a little thick.
20407	After this latest objective, I think I see a bit of me in you. I mean, we are heroes.
20408	I loved dinosaurs when I was a kid. I love ‘em even more now. That’s why it is great to have someone like you around who can deal with these objectives while I work with the dinosaurs. That makes you all kinds of awesome... not my awesome, but awesome in your own way.
20409	You really took a bite out of that last objective.
20410	Wonderful, isn't it? This is a paradise. But it is missing what it once had... until we bring them back.
20411	This place will show people something spectacular. Dinosaurs. No longer confined to our imaginations. Dinosaurs in the flesh.
20412	And the moment people see them, that moment of astonishment, of magic... Well, you're going to be a part of that spectacle.
20413	Jurassic Park will open on schedule. And the world will be as it once was: a land of the dinosaurs
20414	Ah, good, good. Glad to see you're getting settled in. I want to introduce you to Lily Halford, who is our director of operations here at the park. She’ll get you up to speed.
20415	Thank you, Dr. Hammond.
20416	John, please.
20417	Oh, right then, as Dr. Hammond, oh, John, has already told you, our goal is to get Jurassic Park fully operational as quickly, and safely, as we can. We are literally doing things that were considered impossible, so it will be a challenge.
20418	Making the impossible, possible. Yes, yes, I rather like that.
20419	We will need to prep the facility for the dinosaurs. Begin with a functioning Visitor Centre. And a Science Centre. And remember that both must be connected to pathways. Oh, and power, as well.
20420	I can see that all is in good hands. Do carry on.
20421	We will keep you updated.
20422	Splendid, absolutely splendid.
20423	Jurassic Park has a top geneticist. Top. Dr. Henry Wu. I should expect that you’ll be meeting him soon, that is, if you haven’t already.
20424	I’m settled in and ready to get started. So if we’re to get the dinosaurs we want, we first need a hatchery. If you could construct one then my staff and I can get to work.
20425	Velociraptors. Yes, we’re going to start with raptors. I know you may have concerns. But, both John and I agree that they represent some of our most viable candidates. You’ll need to synthesize their eggs using the available genome research I’ve provided. And of course, let me know the results the moment you have them.
20426	Our first synthesis was unsuccessful. Which means that we clearly have room for improvement. But we don’t stop. We get better. I’ve identified some areas in the synthesis process that need further research. See what you can learn at the Science Centre and get back to me.
20427	We’re beginning with raptors? I’m not sure we’re ready.
20428	Every precaution has been taken. I’m following the science, and these dinosaurs are our best chance at success. We’ve learned so much, and will continue to learn as we move forward.
20429	Yes... yes, of course. And I do understand your concern, Ms. Halford.
20430	Every dinosaur carries a certain amount of risk...
20431	And it’s our job to mitigate it as much as possible.
20432	Keep the lawyers out of my hair and the dinosaurs safely and happily within their enclosures, and you shall have my eternal gratitude.
20433	Dr. Hammond, does that mean we have your authorization to proceed?
20434	Yes. Most enthusiastically.
20435	We need the animals comfortable in their enclosures. The less they feel stress over their captivity, the more they’ll begin to act within their expected behaviors This is better for them and, obviously, better for us. Check on the raptors' welfare, and remember, they're still getting habituated to their new enclosure.
20436	Even with Dr. Wu’s assurances, we’ll want the proper response teams in place. I’m not saying anything will go wrong. I’m just erring on the side of caution.
20437	We can start with a Ranger Post. Build one inside the Velociraptor enclosure. Then create a Response Facility. From there, assign a Ranger Patrol to the Post.
20438	There isn’t much entertainment and educational value in the park if our visitors cannot see our dinosaurs. I mean, what’s the point, really, if not to see these majestic animals up close?
20439	Well, we can construct viewing galleries which should provide the guests with what you’re after, John.
20440	They won’t believe their eyes.
20441	Which is exactly what we want.
20442	Precisely my thoughts as well, Lily. And why they’ll want to keep coming back time and time again to Jurassic Park.
20443	Our dinosaurs offer priceless memories for a reasonable fee.
20444	Ah, yes, now you're getting it.
20445	We need to get a Paleo-Medical Facility in place to ensure any sick or injured dinosaurs can be taken care of.
20446	That's a good idea. We need to keep our dinosaurs healthy.
20447	I’m in need of more genetic samples than we have here at the park. We can send out expeditions of our own to gather fossils. But what we really need is for you to get an Expedition Centre under construction. Then, we can extract DNA from these new fossils gathered in the field and rebuild an even more diverse set of dinosaur genome sequences. This should be your priority.
20448	Also, release a new herbivore into an enclosure. I want to observe these animals in the wild. I mean, as wild as we will allow.
20449	With so many moving parts, I want to make sure we don’t lose sight of our reason for being on the island in the first place... the dinosaurs. Their lives come by our hands, and now they rely on us for their continued existence. This is our responsibility, and one we cannot take lightly. I want you to be sure that our dinosaurs are as comfortable as possible
20450	Dr. Wu and Dr. Hammond would both like us to increase the diversity of animal species in the park. And then, construct a ride where they can be viewed. Make it something impressive.
20451	We are mere moments away from opening Jurassic Park, and I now hear word we have sick dinosaurs? Someone offer me assurances...
20452	Of course, of course. We’re on top of it, Dr. Hammond. We’re sending out a mobile veterinary unit from the Paleo Medical Facility even as we speak, aren’t we, Lily?
20453	Yes, of course. They’ll get us a diagnosis and then we can develop a cure for the Triceratops.
20454	Perfect, we have a plan. That means everything is completely under control. This doesn’t even qualify as a minor setback.
20455	Considering all of the obstacles that have been placed before us getting Jurassic Park to this point, I’m inclined to agree.
20456	Whatever it takes, see to it. And, Henry, let me know the moment this has been resolved.
20457	Understood.
20458	Lily, do carry on.
20459	Thank you. As Dr. Wu said, everything is under control.
20460	Welcome to Jurassic Park!
20461	I’m not sure which is more miraculous... bringing the dinosaurs back from extinction, or finally opening Jurassic Park to the public.
20462	Yet here we are.
20463	Well done, John.
20464	A tribute to us all. And to the power of dreams.
20465	And to the public’s ongoing fascination with these prehistoric animals.
20466	May it never die.
20467	Truer words, Ms. Halford. And now, I want to watch the only thing more interesting than the dinosaurs.
20468	What might that be?
20469	Observing people seeing dinosaurs for the first time.
20470	Oh, and having an ice cream. Come on, then, I’m buying.
20471	So far, Jurassic Park has been an almost unqualified success. However, we do want to increase our guest comfort. This can be accomplished by making sure that when nature calls, there is a restroom nearby. Shelters will be appreciated, if, and I repeat, this is a big “if”, if some of our animals escape their enclosures. And the closer our hotels are to the dinosaurs, the more likely it is the guests will enjoy their stay. And we most definitely want that.
20472	We need to make sure our guests needs are catered for. Let’s build some amenities to help with that. There’s going to be less appetite for dinosaurs if our guests appetites aren’t taken care of.
20473	Jurassic Park sits at the intersection of both science and commerce. One provides for the other. So the higher the park rating, the more income we have to support Dr. Wu and his research. New shops and attractions, and yes, new dinosaurs, will make the park more appealing and more profitable.
20474	Part of the excitement of being near the dinosaurs is the dangerous nature of some of them.
20475	The allure is instinctual fear.
20476	But what we're really looking for is something bigger and better.
20477	Do you want a T. rex?
20478	Can I have a T. rex?
20479	Wait, what? Really, we can have a T. rex?
20480	Once you expand the park and create a suitable enclosure.
20481	Expanding the size of the park is a brilliant idea and the T. rex is the most iconic of the dinosaurs, and now, when people come to Jurassic Park, they can see one for themselves.
20482	And fear they might get eaten by one.
20483	The illusion of risk, not actual risk, is what we strive to achieve.
20484	And we’ll have a T. rex.
20485	It’s the gates. All the gates are open!
20486	Do something! Quickly!
20487	This is bad... the dinosaurs have access to the entire park. And to the guests.
20488	Is this a malfunction? A problem somewhere in your security code?
20489	We’re trying to get as much information as possible.
20490	I don’t understand all those damn lines and numbers. And programmers, don’t get me started.
20491	It appears to be sabotage. Perhaps an inside attack. We’ll need to get the guests to the emergency shelters.
20492	Yes, of course.
20493	Our first priority is to get the animals back to the enclosures.
20494	It should be the safety of our guests by opening up our emergency shelters.
20495	With one, we get the other. Agreed?
20496	All right.
20497	I agree.
20498	Then see to it. Don’t let our dream... my dream... be lost to history.
20499	Save the dinosaurs. Save the guests. And save Jurassic Park.
20500	Well, even with a few minor setbacks, Jurassic Park is thriving. This is in spite of the fact that there are those who would wish to see us fail.
20501	Or take our dinosaurs and our science for their own.
20502	What people experience at Jurassic Park is beyond calculation. Of that there can be no doubt. Still, I think we can go higher, and exceed our own expectations.
20503	We’ll get the numbers up in attendance. More guests should improve our ratings.
20504	Yes, as will a higher species count.
20505	Together, we’ve brought dinosaurs into this world. Now, let’s bring the world to the dinosaurs.
20506	That is quite... um, unimpressive. Say, how long ago was this place abandoned by InGen?
20507	Oh, years. After the... incident... at our first site.
20508	We listened to the concerns, doctor. That’s why Jurassic Park: San Diego was put on hold.
20509	Hold, right, but not cancelled, Mr., Mr. Thompson.
20510	I believe in the work. You know? that’s why I’m here.
20511	Yeah, and I’m here because I believe that I can advise you on how to avoid mistakes made previously.
20512	Understood. I know I can realize the original vision for this park.
20513	I admire your confidence. I’ve seen it before.
20514	Welcome to San Diego, Dr. Malcolm. My name's Lily Halford. I'm in charge of Operations, and I must say, it’s absolutely fantastic that you’re here. Mr. Thompson wasn’t sure you’d say yes.
20515	Well, Mr. Thompson doesn't understand chaos... or alimony payments. But, you know he’ll, he'll learn. As you will, Lily. It comes with the territory, I suppose.
20516	I’m looking forward to it. I think.
20517	Well, as you can see, at the moment, the entire facility is a bit of a mess.
20518	Yeah... I saw it from the air. Looks even worse from the ground.
20519	Everything has to start somewhere, even when it’s starting over. So why don’t we begin with the construction of a Response Facility and then take it from there?
20520	I once heard someone say that “determination is power.” And I like that. But let’s flip it around. Together, we are determined to power everything. With actual power. How does that sound?
20521	So, I thought we’d get the buildings repaired.
20522	Get them powered up, and I figure we’ll take it from there. We should be ready for dinosaurs in no time.
20523	Exciting day. The first dinosaurs are arriving from what remains of our operation on Isla Sorna.
20524	Well wait a minute, isn't - isn’t most of the original site destroyed?
20525	Destroyed, but not abandoned. The assets still belong to InGen, and we’re going to leverage them here in our new park.
20526	We’re starting with a herbivore. We want to make sure it’s well cared for, obviously, so we’ll be monitoring its welfare.
20527	Haha, Hope for the best, plan for the worst.
20528	And make sure you can find the nearest exit.
20529	It’s really starting to feel like the park is coming together.
20530	I’ve already seen one come apart.
20531	All of our safety precautions are in place, Dr. Malcolm. They have to be with the latest deliveries. We have a small carnivore arriving.
20532	And larger carnivores too, which are not any kind of cute, if you ask me.
20533	Well, knowing your history with a particular species, Mr. Thompson thought it best not to trouble you with the details. 
20534	Oh, yeah no, I've seen what a T. rex can do. My therapist and I talk about it all the time. It's an alpha predator, and now you're bringing it here...
20535	Haha, no no. We know what we're doing.
20536	Yes, yes... and here’s the thing Thompson. I know what you're doing as well.
20537	These species, the T. rex and the Compsognathus, are central to our success at the park. They’ll draw in the crowds. So now that they’re here, let’s ensure they’re comfortable.
20538	We are making tremendous strides here at the park, and soon we'll be fully operational. But we’ll need to increase our dinosaurs’ comfort. See to it, will you?
20539	We did it.
20540	This wouldn’t have happened without you Dr. Malcolm.
20541	Hey, I want it on record, I'm not in favor of this park’s existence.
20542	But this was John Hammond’s dream... delayed, but not denied.
20543	Jurassic Park: San Diego. Isn’t it something?
20544	Oh, it’s something all right. A living illusion.
20545	Dr. Malcolm, this facility brings needed stability to InGen’s operations. That’s a win for us both.
20546	So it would appear.
20547	And the park is a unique opportunity for our guests.
20548	Or, you know, for the hungry dinosaurs.
20549	As impressive as the park is, it can always be improved. Specifically, in the area of guest comfort. We need to get the numbers up.
20550	Who doesn’t love a cold drink? And it's a good way to keep up our profits. Keep an eye on the Drinks Amenity and the money should flow.
20551	Ultimately, everyone is at the park for one reason... to see dinosaurs. This in the only place in the world they can. And they want to. That’s why you need to increase our Dinosaur Visibility. Give our guests a view their eyes won’t believe.
20552	Two more dinosaurs are inbound, and I need the park ready for their delivery. They’ll also require suitable enclosures and support.
20553	So what’s the, uh, what's the latest addition to the menu? Besides us.
20554	A few herbivores. Simple to manage.
20555	There’s nothing “simple” about managing dinosaurs.
20556	Things are going as planned...
20557	...or so it appears.
20558	But InGen needs more samples. So we’re returning to traditional paleontology.
20559	A simpler time, when the science was digging bones out of the ground, instead of bringing them to life.
20560	I’ve given Ms. Halford the requirements.
20561	We’ve got to increase guest count.
20562	We’re making solid progress, but we still need more dinosaurs. One way we get there is by increasing a dinosaur’s genome percentage. See that our scientists are focused on making it happen.
20563	Don't forget to check in with the Expedition Centre. It should be a beehive of activity and there’s always opportunity to found.
20564	Of course, oh, of course.
20565	And then build an Expedition Centre so we can send out teams to get new genome samples, which will give us more species diversity.
20566	That's sensible, I guess…
20567	This should help our park rating, which we want to increase.
20568	Well, that's, um… ah... ambitious.
20569	And that should lead to greater profits.
20570	Ha, so predictable.
20571	See, you know there are some patterns in the universe that defy the laws of chaos by being so obvious, and the so-called “bottom line” is one of the shining stars. That's what caused the original park to collapse: Hubris and greed.
20572	Your concern is noted, Dr. Malcolm. But InGen needs to recover its losses, and this park is helping that cause. We’ve learned from our mistakes.
20573	I fear that what you’ve learned is that, like a phoenix, InGen has risen from the ashes of disaster. Which means you think you can do so again.
20574	We need to acquire more land.
20575	Oh, that sounds all kinds of concerning.
20576	We’re outgrowing our current facility size. Success breeds expansion.
20577	Mmhmm. Yeah, I gotta caution against, uh, biting off more than you can chew. Which isn’t a problem for the dinosaurs, but is a recurring issue for humanity.
20578	I think it'll be all right, Dr. Malcolm. The state of California has approved the permits. They’re as excited by Jurassic Park: San Diego’s success as we are.
20579	There are a few requirements.
20580	Yes, as one would expect. And I’m one who would expect.
20581	We’ll need to purchase the land, but then we should be good to go.
20582	Good to go, er, where? You know, that’s always been one of the issues with this type of paleontology, hasn’t it? Not where we are, but where we’re headed. Because that’s where you find chaos, waiting… patiently.
20583	We’ve seen the dinosaurs in their natural, well, as natural as we can make them, environments. But the scientists are interested in learning about the animals at the peak of their capabilities. This should also make them more appealing to our guests.
20584	And this, this will involve... what, precisely?
20585	Not fighting... hunting. In order to fully study the behavioral ecology of these animals, we need to recreate the hunter-prey dynamic as closely as possible.
20586	Oh, good, because for a hot second there, jeez, I thought you were suggesting staged dinosaur fights for fun and profit.
20587	That would be highly unethical.
20588	In nature, animals hunt to survive, and they choose when to do so. And now, you're going to force them?
20589	Perish the thought. Could you remind me again where the emergency exits are…
20590	Species Count is a measure of how the park is doing. And how you are doing.
20591	Of course we want everyone to come visit the dinosaurs. But we also want to track specific guest types that can affect our ratings. Remember to stay focused on our Park Rating for continued success.
20592	I’m seeing new land that is available to build on. We can expand the park. Really make it something.
20593	Jurassic Park: San Diego. We really did bring it back from the brink.
20594	And the dinosaurs back from beyond it.
20595	There’s still more to do if we are to see the facility at its peak. More land should help.
20596	I would think that more guests and more dinosaurs with a greater variety of species would work as well.
20597	Correct, let’s get our park rating up across the board. What do you think, Dr. Malcolm?
20598	Well, y'know, Thomas Edison, uh, once said that just because something doesn’t go as planned doesn’t mean it’s useless. And when it comes to Jurassic Park, that has, surprisingly, turned out to be true. For now.
20599	So perhaps, what's been achieved in San Diego is a tribute to those who would never leave the island. A painful and tragic legacy, but one that would be the foundation of a world forever changed by resurrecting its past, and then turning it into theme park attractions.
20600	The fact that no one could have predicted that dinosaurs and humans would breathe the same air, uh, gives me pause. Ha, and it also… it also makes me smile.
20601	So this is where all the excitement happened?
20602	Yes, this is the place.
20603	Simply amazing. And here we will do it again.
20604	In addition to capturing the dinosaurs, which will serve as our foundation, I purchased InGen because I believe in the science. You can reproduce your results, can’t you, Dr. Wu?
20605	Of course I can do it. But it's going to take considerable effort and resources to get the science back to where it was.
20606	And you will be well compensated for your efforts. Of course, I demand results.
20607	And you will have them.
20608	You know, people assume that when you reach the status of billionaire, that the thing you most enjoy is power. But do you know what that kind of money really buys?
20609	By all means, enlighten me, Mr. Masrani.
20610	Freedom. Freedom, to do what you want. To pursue your ambitions and your passions. The obstacles that stand before most people you can simply sweep aside with financial incentives. And the occasional pay-off.
20611	Money enables science to do the impossible.
20612	Yes it does. And money allows us to fulfil John Hammond’s dream and make it a reality.
20613	A sight to behold, Dr. Wu.
20614	When I left Isla Nublar last time, I never thought I’d return. And certainly never thought I’d rebuild Jurassic Park.
20615	Oh, but you haven't. You’ve helped me create something even better. Bigger, more ambitious and more financially viable. Dinosaurs for the masses.
20616	Anyone can create a park. But it takes genius to create a world.
20617	I trust you’re settled in and are ready to get started.
20618	This is Lily Halford, and she’s coordinating operations. Ms. Halford?
20619	Thank you, Mr. Masrani. I think I speak for everyone here when I say we are very grateful for this opportunity you’ve given us.
20620	As a boy, I loved to play with toy animals, and now, with this island and the dinosaurs, I have the greatest toy set imaginable. I want that joy, that excitement, I had as a child... I want it to be felt by everyone. You will make that happen.
20621	We’ll need to start by getting a control center and response facility on-line. They’ll all require power. This will give us a strong foundation.
20622	And then, dinosaurs.
20623	That is the plan.
20624	This is my investment, in the vision... and in my people.
20625	Please, don’t let me get in the way.
20626	The facility is ready for our first dinosaur. Send a capture team out to collect an Ankylosaurus. They’ve proven to be a stable species and will be valuable as I rebuild our science operations.
20627	Now, I want to run a full series of tests, so the details matter. You need to get the dinosaur’s comfort level up. And build a viewing platform so my team can keep an eye on the subject. When all goes well, we can transfer the animal to a holding facility we’ve established off the island.
20628	If you were paying attention, then there shouldn’t be any questions.
20629	Our target is the Ankylosaurus. Lovely creature. Capture it and then secure it in an enclosure.
20630	While this is a team effort, I’m sure you understand that my vision carries some weight. With that said, I want a Ranger Post constructed and then a team assigned to it. From there, they can perform status checks on the animals.
20631	Is your Ankylosaurus happy? The best way to find out is to monitor their comfort level and increase it as necessary.
20632	Orson Welles once said... this was about a movie studio... he said that it was “the biggest electric train set a boy ever had.” Of course, he never had dinosaurs. I want to make sure we can see and monitor the Ankylosaurus. Build a Viewing Platform, will you? I realize that may have sounded like a suggestion, but I know you understand.
20633	We need to move these animals to the Holding Facility off-site. Once their enclosure is ready, we can bring them to Jurassic World.
20634	I’m hearing good things so far.
20635	Of course you are. We’re capturing some of the escaped dinosaurs from the park's past difficulties.
20636	Past difficulties? People died.
20637	They did. And others lived. And the dinosaurs we had under our care then, ones that were roaming free, are coming back into the fold.
20638	Good. Though I am concerned that these dinosaurs have had a taste of freedom.
20639	I’ve given them life. And all the complexities that come with it. But we can manage. I mean, that’s why you brought me here, isn’t it?
20640	You, Dr. Wu, are a means to an end. I hope you don’t find that insulting.
20641	No, quite the opposite.
20642	Excellent. What are our next steps?
20643	Well, we need two more species. We’ll run them through the same process as the Ankylosaurus.
20644	Keep me updated. I want progress.
20645	Like all science, it’s just a matter of time.
20646	I hope you’re ready for some excitement. I certainly am. Today, we need to capture several dinosaurs of the same species and get them back under our control. Captive and in an enclosure. I’m ready when you are. Which should be now.
20647	Let’s crack on with these next tasks, then, shall we? You’re responsible for performing Status Checks and increasing the dinosaurs' welfare. Should be straightforward. And I know you’re up to the job.
20648	I love keeping an eye on my dinosaurs. But I just don’t have the time to do so as much as I’d like. That’s why I have you. Be my eyes and monitor these animals.
20649	These dinosaurs are ready to move to the Holding Facility. Let’s not keep them, or me, waiting.
20650	There’s a new dinosaur out in the wild. Track the animal and capture it, so we can bring it back into the fold.
20651	We’ve created dinosaurs. We have them on display. And for science. But that means we need to monitor our flock. I want Status Checks routinely performed on all of our dinosaurs. This is how we maintain our advantage.
20652	This dinosaur isn’t responding as we’d hoped. It’ll need the resources that are available at our Paleo-Medical Facility.
20653	The thrill of the hunt without the guilt of the kill. That’s our mission. Tranquilize this dinosaur, and then we’ll get it the best treatment my money can buy at the Paleo-Medical Facility.
20654	Now that we have the dinosaur back home, why don’t we make it feel like a real home? Watch the ratings and get the enclosure all comfy.
20655	It’s time to move the dinosaurs. Next stop, our Holding Facility.
20656	We’re expanding our reach throughout the island. This means more opportunities to capture more dinosaurs.
20657	I’m specifically in need of a Triceratops. My team will need to monitor it and then we can transfer it off the island as we’ve done before.
20658	Shouldn’t we intervene?
20659	This is instinctual behavior Unfortunate, but not unanticipated. Besides, how would we?
20660	Survival of the fittest at its most primitive. Its most prehistoric. We are witnessing history in action.
20661	Ugh, I can’t watch.
20662	And I can’t turn away.
20663	I’ll send out a team to collect what we can before the scavengers pick over the carcass.
20664	Collect the body. I have plans for it.
20665	We’ve come so far, so fast. But there are still things to be done if we are to truly deliver on our mandate from Mr. Masrani. An Expedition Centre, first off. Then, we can send out park teams to capture three more species here on the island. Also, see if you can locate another key dinosaur... capture it, then monitor it. And transfer it as before.
20666	I don’t expect results, I demand them. I realize we are dealing with time measured in tens of millions of years, but that is for the dinosaurs, not us. We move quickly. Our time, my friends, is limited. Let’s get motivated.
20667	This is an across the board objective. Every dinosaur... every species... we want to increase their comfort rating. In fact, we're the only ones that should feel any discomfort. Well, truth be told... you, actually.
20668	We’re moving all the animals to our Holding Facility. This will be a huge undertaking, so I’m expecting nothing less than your best. And you’re going to give it to me.
20669	John Hammond had his vision, and I have mine. I’d like to think that, had things been different, he and I would have been good partners. His passion combined with my business savvy... it would have been quite the team.
20670	But alas, it was not to be. And I was left to pick up the pieces of what might have been, and turn it into what should have been all along. A premiere, world-class tourist destination. The only place on the planet where you can experience dinosaurs up close and personal.
20671	Here, people will once again discover the wonders of this world. They will have a renewed sense of life. And they will gladly, willingly, eagerly pay for that experience.
20672	Science didn’t bring back dinosaurs. It brought back... possibilities. Hope. This is what I see. This is Jurassic World.
20673	Hey, Cabot Finch at your service. Well, actually, I guess you’re kind of at mine. Details. I’ve been tasked with getting Jurassic World ready for the public. With your help, of course. We’ll begin with a Science Centre. And it will have to be powered. So, get to doing the service thing.
20674	We’ve got a Triceratops in-bound, and we want to get it settled in to its enclosure. Then we'll do what we can to make it comfortable. Which I’m sure you can handle, or I’d be talking to someone else.
20675	Things are taking shape, but we need a Response Facility. Oh, and a Paleo-Medical Facility as well. Get it built and ready.
20676	Now that dinosaurs are arriving, we need to get them into appropriate enclosures. See to it.
20677	I want to make sure our guests have every comfort. We should construct bathrooms and other things in strategic locations, and some emergency shelters, just in case.
20678	Jurassic World is the envy of... the world. Where else can one travel to see wonders such as these? And they must be seen. So do what you can to increase our dinosaur visibility.
20679	It’s a beautiful day to open a new chapter in the history of humanity.
20680	Once these gates are open, there’s no going back.
20681	We’re ready, Mr. Masrani.
20682	This is it. Jurassic World. I can’t help but wonder what John Hammond would think of all this…
20683	We want to ensure that our guests are having the best Jurassic World experience possible. Increasing our amenity coverage should do the trick. Keep an eye on our guest comfort numbers and get ‘em where we’d like. And that is up.
20684	The last of the viable candidates from Sorna are arriving, let's get them settled in.
20685	Now that we have these dinosaurs, I want them placed in suitable enclosures. These assets our central to our operation. No dinosaurs, no Jurassic World. Please remember this and act accordingly.
20686	More dinosaurs... yay! Nothing can go wrong, like, ever. We can get more species using the Expedition Centre. This is a good idea, someone once said.
20687	It’s become clear I can’t do everything on my own... well, it’s been told to me, anyway. Rather harshly, I might add. Point is, we need extra hands. So we’re adding some fresh blood to the team. Meet Claire Dearing.
20688	Hi. Thank you, Cabot. I’m so excited to be part of the team. I look forward to us all working together to make Jurassic World all that it can, and should, be for our guests and our dinosaurs.
20689	Now, our first task is to increase our guest count. I’m confident we can get this done.
20690	"My understanding is that the gyrosphere attraction is ready? This is essential to giving our guests those true ""you are there"" dinosaur moments that will drive new and repeat business. That means, of course, that we’ll need to make sure they see plenty of dinosaurs, Claire. More than they can handle..."
20691	Yes sir. We can handle that.
20692	Claire, Mr. Masrani would like to see an uptick in the guest count. That means we need enough accommodation to cater to a larger audience. Those are real profit generators.
20693	Absolutely. We will make sure to focus on it as we move forward.
20694	Hey, look, we’re definitely not all about that money. But we’re also not not about it either. Uh, I guess what I’m saying is that the dinosaurs come first. But maybe we can squeeze some more from our operations. The amenities and such.
20695	Until I knew better, I’d always believed that the dinosaurs existed only on land.
20696	The dinosaurs, like all living things, originated in the sea. Some never left. We call them marine reptiles, however.
20697	Like the Mosasaurus?
20698	We’ll get one ready.
20699	You can do that?
20700	It’ll mean construction of a lagoon and hatchery. And it’ll be expensive.
20701	That is no longer something I worry about. See that it is done. Whatever it takes. And... include a viewing gallery with it. I want a seat in the front row for the first show.
20702	Our guests get really excited by our water animals, the Mosasaurus being chief among them. Make sure you research it and increase its genome percentage.
20703	Dr. Wu is looking at increasing the Velociraptor population, so we’re going to be bringing in an ex-military specialist. He’s a bit of a free spirit, so you’ll need to keep him on track.
20704	Name’s Grady. Owen Grady. My job here is to look after the well-being of the dinosaurs. I’m an animal behaviorist.
20705	First things first, let’s incubate and release a squad of Velociraptors. Owen is here to ensure everything goes to plan.
20706	First things first, let’s incubate and release a pack of Velociraptors. Owen is here to ensure everything goes to plan.
20707	Finally, an idea I can get behind. I mean, literally. You can now research Heavy Fences. That’s good, right? Unless... unless they need them to hold back something even bigger and badder, haha.
20708	Okay, we’re going to release an Indominus Rex.
20709	Ah, whoa. The Indominus Rex is a plan of Dr. Wu’s, right? Some wild cross-breed?
20710	We call them hybrid dinosaurs.
20711	And these dinosaurs are an on-going learning curve. But yes, let’s make sure all of our security protocols are followed to the letter.
20712	Well, it’s a good thing I’m normally the Alpha around here.
20713	Nature has done a wonderful job with the alpha predators. But I thought... what if it could do more? And then I thought, we can. I can make a hybrid dinosaur. I’m calling this the Indominus Rex...the ultimate predator. Now, I want as much research as possible before I create it, because I’m expecting to show nature a thing or two.
20714	We need as much information on the T. Rex genome as possible. It’s essential, as this will inform the creation of the Indominus Rex. I’m looking for answers, not excuses.
20715	There was a time when some people perceived our work as madness. They said it was impossible. And yet, they now live in a world with dinosaurs. Hybrids are the next stage of that evolutionary chain. The Indominus Rex will blaze the trail for all that follow.
20716	Look at it. Magnificent. I’ve taken the best traits from a number of species and optimized them. Now they live and breathe as the Indominus Rex. One can only imagine how this animal would have fared all those millions of years ago. Prehistoric genetics combined with modern scientific engineering as only we can. As only I can. It’s perfection.
20717	Based on our performance up until now, I feel some very handsome rewards in our future. Or at least in mine.
20718	Dr. Wu wanted to discuss something.
20719	Yeah, from what I heard, it's some final push to really take Jurassic World over the top.
20720	You’ve heard correctly, Mr. Grady. We need to increase our paleo diversity. More species.
20721	Help me out here, Claire.
20722	Owen has some... concerns about hybrids.
20723	I mean, we’re already doing something unnatural here, so these animals, they’re even more unnatural. Super-unnatural.
20724	This is coming from Mr. Masrani himself. More species equals more profit.
20725	And more danger.
20726	Not if we all do our jobs. Utilizing the Expedition Centre will be essential to achieving our goal.
20727	This is a plan I can get behind. And eventually take credit for.
20728	Hey, why don’t we work together on this one? We want to get our Guest Count up. Is that cool? Great, now that I’ve done my part by telling you, you can get to doing yours, partner, haha.
20729	Do you know the true meaning of success? I don’t, but increasing our Park Rating is probably a decent first step.
20730	People think science created the dinosaurs. Bzzzz. Wrong. What created them was money. A whole boatload of it. And now those dinosaurs should be generating cash, money for us. That’s called ROI. Return on investment. It’s time to maximize profits and make bank. Get that balance as high as it will go, haha. Call it greed if you want. I call it... nature.
20731	So much has changed since the last time I saw the island. Dreams and lives destroyed. The world coming to terms with what we did, or failed to do, when all hell broke loose.
20732	Hearings... Depositions… Everyone looking for someone to blame. Someone to hold accountable.
20733	But some good did come out of that ambition, and out of our mistakes.... the world now has dinosaurs. Again. And everything changed. Including me.
20734	So, why come back? Why refresh the memories? The nightmares? The answer is simple. Our work... My work. It’s not yet finished.
20735	We’re doing all we can. Owen, Finch, the team, and me. Now it’s up to the dinosaurs to forge their own path.
20736	I know we'll be tempted to return. And that it's incumbent on us, all of us, to keep the island isolated and free of human interference. Difficult, but considering what's at stake, for both their lives and ours, necessary.
20737	The dinosaurs will thrive, or they'll slip back into history. Nature will finally take back what we’d stolen. And we'll trust nature to decide.
20738	The dinosaurs’ fate is no longer in our hands. That's the way it should’ve been since the first gene was spliced and the first egg was hatched.
20739	They say it’s not what you take, it’s what you leave behind that matters.
20740	Maybe humanity is finally learning its place. And it’s not on Isla Nublar.
20741	That island belongs to the dinosaurs. Now, it’s their world.
20742	This all needs to be gone. Like we were never here. Amenities, attractions, emergency shelters, restrooms... take them all down. We are leaving only memories. Hopefully the good ones.
20743	I can’t believe they talked me into coming back to the island. Okay, maybe it was a court order, but the end result is the same.
20744	Hey, I’m here, you’re here, and the dinosaurs, they’re still here.
20745	Yes, we’re one big, dysfunctional, family.
20746	Finch, we’ve got a job to do, and a burden to carry. The dinosaurs are our responsibility, like it or not.
20747	That’s the deal. So we might as well get to it.
20748	No time like the present when it comes to the past, eh?
20749	Couldn’t have said it better myself. Let’s start by setting up a base of operations.
20750	We want to reduce our footprint, not increase it. So it’s better to repair buildings than construct new ones.
20751	When everything went south, the animals scattered in all directions. They are now most likely concentrated in areas of the island that remind them of their natural habitats. So we need to start thinking like they do. That’s where we’ll find our Dinosaurs.
20752	Owen, we’re ready to start checking on the welfare of the dinosaurs.
20753	Copy that. We’ve located some Brachiosauruses but we’ll need an enclosure.
20754	And a viewing platform. Once we’ve collected data on the animals’ status, we can release them back into the wild.
20755	We’re on it.
20756	I may not want to look at them, but there are plenty of people who do. Construct a Viewing Gallery to monitor the Brachiosauruses. And, er, brownie points to me for saying that right, haha.
20757	These animals are big, but that’s no reason they shouldn’t be comfortable. Fact is, if my waist size is anything to go by, they may need it more. So let’s keep ‘em comfortable, okay?
20758	Part of our objective on the island is to remove the footprint of our existence. Wipe away the traces of humanity and let the dinosaurs at least believe they are back in their natural habitat. As much as it pains me to say this, that means removing all of the amenity buildings we constructed for Jurassic World. Think progress, but in reverse.
20759	Hey, we’ve got an angry dinosaur…
20760	Is there another kind?
20761	Where is it?
20762	Just rampaging through the base.
20763	That’s bad.
20764	Owen, can you and the team capture it?
20765	Capture it, yeah, We can try…
20766	After we captured the dinosaur, we realized it was suffering from some type of illness. We need to research a cure.
20767	The Baryonyx. Even though I love all the dinosaurs, I’d rather keep as far away from this one as possible. Still, we have to capture one, so I’m putting this on you. Sorry.
20768	The scientists are saying they want to get a medical scan on the Baryonyx. I know it can be a handful, but be careful it doesn’t become a hand off, huh?
20769	This is normally a very dangerous animal but it may not be here much longer. Research is the answer.
20770	We may have a cure. Once we treat the Baryonyx, then we'll know.
20771	This animal has attitude. Maybe being more comfortable will chill it out. At minimum, it’ll be well rested before its next attack.
20772	It’s the Triceratops and Sinoceratops... fighting for dominance and territory.
20773	Let’s tranquilize and capture them. That will give us a chance to monitor their status. We can then release them and they’ll work out their differences.
20774	There will be violence, I assume.
20775	That’s nature. Win by being the strongest, the most intelligent, or with sheer numbers.
20776	And we’ve inserted ourselves into the equation far too often already.
20777	Now we come to the Triceratops and the Sinoceratops. They need an increased comfort rating, too. Basically, all the tops. So do what you can to get to the bottom of it. Huh?
20778	This is almost looking... prehistoric.
20779	Then we're doing our job. Still, we can and should do more. We must remove all the buildings outside of our perimeter.
20780	Owen, it’s Blue.
20781	Wait, you found her?
20782	We think so. But listen, she’s not doing so great. Hurry.
20783	Send me any information you have. I'm headed with the team to her now.
20784	Any word on her status?
20785	We’ve been monitoring Blue from her enclosure. The science team thinks they've narrowed down the problem.
20786	What is it?
20787	A blood infection. She's going to need a transfusion.
20788	From what? There’s no other raptors left.
20789	A T. rex.
20790	Well, that’s um, different.
20791	I owe Blue my life. That was your training. Her loyalty to you saved us both.
20792	And now I can return the favor. Least I can do for a friend, even if she’s sixty-five million years old.
20793	So, where can I find me a T. rex?
20794	Will this really work?
20795	The paleo-medical team says this will give Blue her best shot. Once the transfusion is complete, we can set her free.
20796	Owen, we're going after Blue. You think you can find her?
20797	If she’s alive, then yes, I’ll find her.
20798	She is alive. I believe it.
20799	I’ve never wanted you to be more right, Claire.
20800	This dinosaur, Blue, is incredibly important for a number of reasons. One of which is her connection to Owen Grady. And she’s trained... to an extent. Still, she’s a raptor... we know how they can be and we need to monitor her. Get Blue to an enclosure and treat her as if she was your own. This is the serious me.
20801	Claire, there’s something wrong with Blue. She needs a Medical Scan, like yesterday.
20802	A Medical Team is on its way. We need her to hang on.
20803	I’m not worried. She’s in good hands with you.
20804	And we've got to find her. Her blood can help Blue.
20805	Yeah, yeah, well, finding her might be the easiest part.
20806	Then let's do that first.
20807	This T. Rex may be a lifeline for Blue. I’m leaving this one to you. Get it locked down and keep an eye on it. It’ll definitely have an eye on you, hm.
20808	Tranq the T. rex and bring her to the Paleo-Medical Facility, where they're ready to collect her blood for the transfusion.
20809	Here’s hoping we don’t lose any in the process. Ours, not hers.
20810	Okay, Claire, this one’s on me. We get Blue tranquilized and to the Paleo-Medical facility. Then, it’s on them.
20811	The scientists are ready. And they believe the transfusion will work.
20812	And what do you believe?
20813	We trust them to be right.
20814	Blue is family.
20815	I know.
20816	She’s gonna be okay. Blue’s gonna make it.
20817	We’ve brought so many dinosaurs back from the brink, but this one’s special. I’m happy for you, Owen.
20818	And I’m happy for her. But I’m not sure we can keep Blue and the T. Rex near each other. Like us, they have history.
20819	Like us?
20820	They’ll fight.
20821	We don’t fight. We have disagreements.
20822	So, basically, now, for instance.
20823	No. We’re on the same page. Let’s send Blue and the T. rex to different sides of the island. Just to be sure. Happy?
20824	As a clam. I’m not sure what that means, but I think it’s good.
20825	We’re going to recreate the old by destroying the new.
20826	What do you want demolished?
20827	Everything. All of it. What was here, what we built. The fences... the entire park. What we leave is a refuge, as untouched by humanity as possible.
20828	It’s what the dinosaurs deserve.
20829	If only we’d thought of that first.
20830	This is it. Remove everything that’s left from Jurassic World.
20831	Make it like we were never here.
20832	And the dinosaurs always were.
20833	See you around Blue. Take care of yourself out there, girl.
20834	Just checking out the latest Park Rating, and I love what I see. Keep at it. You’re making me look good.
20835	How do you measure success? I’d say the Park Rating is a good place to start. So well done. Sincerely. And also, remember to share the spotlight.
20836	Looks like success is in our blood. Based on the current Park Rating, you appear to really know how to do the job. And since my job is making sure you’re doing yours, well that’s a win for us both, right? This is where you’re supposed to nod your head in agreement.
20837	The Park Rating definitely has room for improvement. Whether the park has room for you remains to be seen. Improving your results would help, he said hintingly.
20838	In a place full of wonder, this last Park Rating is a disappointment. I’m not saying it’s you, but it’s certainly not me.
20839	I can tell you’re trying. But I won’t... not unless you get this Park Rating up.
20840	Nope, that’s not gonna do. Maybe try getting closer to your subject. Not too close, though, right? I don’t want to deal with the paperwork.
20841	This image is acceptable if I needed a picture of my mother-in-law. But for a dinosaur? Yeah, no. Try again.
20842	How hard is it to take a picture of a dinosaur? Focus... literally.
20843	I wouldn’t say this photo is bad. No, wait, that’s exactly what I would say.
20844	They say a picture is worth a thousand words. This picture however, is only worth one. And I can’t say it out loud.
20845	That’s a nice shot.
20846	Who knew the dinosaurs could be so photogenic? You, apparently.
20847	Great pic. Composition, lighting, subject. This is what we were looking for... or so they tell me.
20848	You’ve really captured the essence of that dinosaur. Nice job.
20849	Well, if nothing else works out for you, at least we know you’re pretty good with a camera.
20850	The dinosaurs’ food supply has been tampered with. Make sure to disinfect their feeders. We can’t have them consuming anything that could adversely affect their health. They are too valuable, especially from a scientific standpoint.
20851	We do everything we can to give these dinosaurs the best chance at life, and someone... some idiot, poisons their food? They’re just lucky that Blue and I didn’t catch them.
20852	Persons unknown appear to have sabotaged the dinosaurs food supply. See that it’s dealt with before real harm happens to the animals.
20853	This latest sickness spreading through our dinosaur population is not natural. Or a failing on our part. Someone has intentionally caused the animals to become ill. Hopefully, we’ve caught it in time.
20854	I know what the dinosaurs are feeling. Don’t ask me how... that I don’t know, exactly. But I can tell when the dinosaurs aren’t right and something’s up for sure.
20855	There are a number of attack vectors that a hostile actor can take against the park, but perhaps none is so pernicious as going after the dinosaurs. I believe this current bout of sick dinosaurs was intentional. Give them the medical attention they need, and I’ll see if I can identify the culprit.
20856	The electrical fences are down. This could be sabotage, or this could be our own failure. Time will tell. However, there is no telling what the dinosaurs might do when they realize the fences are no longer electrified.
20857	I heard once that strong fences make good neighbors. Well, now that the electricity is down, so are the fences. And the neighbors? They're dangerous.
20858	I don’t like this at all. Someone appears to have shut down the grid controlling our electrified fencing. There’s a saboteur among us... a problem that we will need to address. For now, let’s get the fencing back online.
20859	Okay, I need you to pay attention. The gates to the dinosaur enclosures have been opened, and not by us. We don’t yet know the extent of the threat, but we do know we must get those gates closed. Quickly, before both our dinosaurs, and our guests, are in danger.
20860	The dinosaurs are out, and we gotta get the gates back under our control before the park becomes an “all they can eat” buffet.
20861	This is precisely the sort of security failure that keeps me up at night. The gates have been compromised. Most likely sabotage. Deal with getting them closed immediately, before things spiral any further.
20862	I’ve just received a report that some guests are coming down with cases of food poisoning. Hopefully this is unintentional, but it could be malicious. See if you can figure out if there is a common food outlet they visited.
20863	I’m hearing that some of our guests have got the scoots. And I don’t mean they’re moving fast. Well, they might be... but in any case, we want to figure out this mess out.
20864	Threatening the health and well-being of the dinosaurs is one thing, but poisoning our guests, that is quite another. I take this personally. You should as well. Let’s get a handle on what happened. And make sure it doesn’t happen again.
20865	The incubation process... that’s where the dinosaurs really make the transition from scientific creation to living organism. That someone would sabotage the process... well, it’s beyond me.
20866	Why would somebody mess up the incubation process? It’s taking away life at the very moment it is beginning. Sometimes I think humans just aren't worthy of the dinosaurs.
20867	If you really want to hurt our operations... to cut us to the quick... you disrupt the incubation process. And that’s what this sabotage has done. See if you can minimize the damage.
20868	We’ve lost power. Or someone’s cut it. Either way, without power, we can’t function. The park can’t function. Get it fixed before we have a real crisis on our hands.
20869	Oh, this is the opposite of good. Power’s out. I can’t think of any reasons but one... somebody cut it. Like, you’d think everyone would be our friend and want to see us succeed with the dinosaurs. But you’d be wrong.
20870	This may be an accident, or this may be something more nefarious, but either way, we’ve lost power and we need it back. ASAP.
20871	After all we’ve done to bring back these animals, this is the thanks we get... protests. Don’t they realize that by hurting us, they’re hurting the dinosaurs?
20872	I’ve protested a few things in my day. Mostly the lack of pizza in the mess hall. So I’m sympathetic to the process, but not the cause. People don’t understand the dinosaurs, so they don’t understand what we do to take care of them.
20873	It’s hard enough trying to keep things quiet and calm around here, and now we have these protesters making it that much more difficult. Our ratings and guest numbers will drop as long as they’re around. Deal with them as best you can.
20874	With all of the issues we must contend with, I didn’t really consider monetary theft to be something to keep on our radar. But I was wrong. Let’s do what we can to overcome any hit we’ve taken.
20875	You know what I hate worse than a thief? Well, a lot of things, actually, but in this case, there’s been actual theft. And I hate that. Taking money from us is taking money away from the animals. And also us.
20876	There’s been a theft of funds from the park. It may adversely impact operations. And it is a failure of our security initiatives. Vigilance will be required.
20877	Strong rain and hurricane force winds are on the horizon. Batten down the hatches and be ready. Storms and dinosaurs? That’s been very bad mojo in the past.
20878	As much as we’d like to believe that we are able to control nature, it occasionally likes to reminds us who is really in charge. This time, in the form of a hurricane. Prepare the park. We must be ready.
20879	There’s a tropical storm bearing down on us. That brings wind and rain which can damage buildings and vehicles. And the smarter dinosaurs, they’ll see this as an opportunity, so stay on your toes.
20880	Is that a sandstorm? Let’s watch for power outages, and be ready with repairs.
20881	I’ve just received a report that a sand storm may hit the park shortly. It can do real damage, especially to our infrastructure. This is a challenge to our operations... be ready to push yourself. Be ready for anything.
20882	This ain't gonna be no day at the beach, but we’re gonna have sand everywhere. It’ll clog up machinery and vehicles. We don’t want it knocking out the power and creating a security issue with the dinosaurs. Be ready.
20883	The snow may look beautiful, but it can wreak havoc with our systems. Make sure you stay alert and attend to any issues as they arise.
20884	Freezing temperatures and windswept snow can pose a threat to our operations. Stay on your toes and be ready to act quickly.
20885	It looks like we’ve got a big snow storm coming in hot. And that’s cold.
20886	Tornado inbound. We need to get the guests into shelters, and do what we can to lock down the dinosaurs. Quickly.
20887	With a tornado headed this way, our guests are in grave danger. Get them sheltered while we still have time.
20888	We’ll need to face this twister head-on, and listen... I don’t want us to end up with a raptornado. That means getting the dinosaurs safely tucked away.
20889	Our guests can be as different as our dinosaurs. They want amenities that cater to their interests.
20890	This is a dangerous place... the park. The guests want the illusion of danger, and new amenities can help support that. Let them feel the thrill of being face to snout with a dinosaur. Our job is to keep that fear from becoming real.
20891	The dinosaurs definitely bring the “wow” factor, but we can make that even bigger with better attractions.
20892	You’d think that standing next to a living, breathing dinosaur would be enough... but people always want more. More exciting attractions might be what we need.
20893	While our science is paramount, I do understand that the guests enjoy attractions that get them feeling closer and more connected to the dinosaurs. So give them what they want as long as it doesn’t conflict with what I need.
20894	There is really only one thing better than taking care of the dinosaurs, and that’s seeing new ones brought to life. Oh, and good corn dog, with some mustard. Okay, so two things.
20895	There are new animals you can create. Species diversity benefits everyone - the scientists, the guests, and yes, even the dinosaurs.
20896	If it’s not obvious by now, the only thing keeping this a park and not a prehistoric hunting ground are the fences. Let’s see what we can do to improve them.
20897	Fences and gates. Enclosures. Want to know why I like them? Because it keeps them away from us.
20898	Stronger fences and stronger gates is something I wholeheartedly support.
20899	Don’t forget about nutrition. Most of the animals have a preferred diet. Specialized feeders will make sure they’re getting what they want to eat. Oh, and what they need to eat as well.
20900	I’m creating life... but you must maintain it. Make sure the animals have the proper feeders. They are what they eat.
20901	All living creatures have basic needs... Food being primary among them. The animals need to have the right amount of feeders stocked with their preferred fare. We don’t want hungry dinosaurs, because if they’re desperate to eat, we’re on the menu.
20902	Happy guests are repeat customers and our best form of advertisement.
20903	Our guests' comfort and safety is as important as the dinosaurs. So why don’t we see if we can make them feel at home while they visit the dinosaurs’ home.
20904	Look at this way... comfortable customers are gonna be inclined to spend more and give us a higher rating, huh? Haha! Hey, at least somebody can relax around here.
20905	If we focus on the guests the way we focus on the dinosaurs, this park will be a runaway success.
20906	The park is coming together, but we can always use more infrastructure. New buildings and upgrades keep us current. And ready.
20907	Research upgrades for our buildings so that we can support more science. The result? Expanded opportunities for the park, in both dinosaurs and exhibits.
20908	We want the park to be as new and upgraded as possible. The more buildings, the better. The better the buildings, also the better.
20909	The more stable our infrastructure, the more we can keep our attention where it belongs... monitoring the dinosaurs.
20910	Can you imagine this place without electricity. I can, and it’s not a pretty picture. Stay on top of it.
20911	People have accused me of always wanting more power. And honestly, they're not exactly incorrect. But not in the way they might imagine. Power keeps the park operational.
20912	All of our science... the equipment, the computers... it’s dependent on electricity. Without it, we are literally and figuratively in the dark. Power is what allows me to create dinosaurs. So I hope you understand its importance.
20913	Welcome to the Amphitheater, a stunning facility that allows us to showcase these marvelous prehistoric animals in a state-of-the-art setting. 
20914	We hope that you have been thoroughly enjoying your visit to the park. Sit back and be prepared to be amazed by our jaw-dropping dinosaurs. 
20915	We are delighted to welcome you to our tremendous Amphitheater. Every section of this venue offers an unforgettable view of our breathtaking dinosaurs. 
20916	This beautiful, open-air setting offers a unique opportunity to see dinosaurs walk the Earth once more, just as they roamed the planet millions of years ago. 
20917	We don't expect our visitors to travel halfway around the world. We want to bring the world's great attractions to you, right here in this very location.
20918	John Hammond dreamt of bringing this outstanding structure to you, the people. Now, the dreams of a visionary have been fully realized and an extraordinary experience awaits.
20919	Never before has humanity been gifted with the chance to see living, breathing dinosaurs in the flesh. No animatronics, no illusions. Actual dinosaurs. 
20920	As you entered the venue, you joined us on a journey through prehistory. A journey that mankind had never been able to embark upon before. 
20921	Although this remarkable Amphitheater is a true structural marvel, it is the astounding dinosaurs that you see before you that undoubtedly steal the show. 
20922	This spectacular Amphitheater removes the reinforced barriers that separate man from dinosaur. Ladies and gentlemen, cast your eyes upon these prehistorical wonders.
20923	No other park in the world offers an experience like this; the views are unparalleled, the sounds are sensational, the dinosaurs inconceivably impressive. 
20924	If you would like to learn more about any of the dinosaurs you see today, please keep an eye out for the information points located in the foyer circle. 
20925	As we reach our phenomenal aviary, we would like to take a moment to thank you for joining us on this special park tour.
20926	Not all prehistoric life was confined to the land. Nor was it restricted to the seas. Millions of years ago, winged reptiles soared through the air with agility and grace.
20927	This aviary is a custom-built structure, created to house the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight. 
20928	Our flying reptiles obviously have very different needs to other prehistoric animals. Every effort is made to provide a hospitable habitat, a delicious diet and a stable social setting.
20929	Although pterosaurs are not ancestors of modern-day birds, they are more closely related to them than they are to dinosaurs or any modern reptiles.
20930	With the help of world-class avian experts, we constructed this terrific enclosure to safely and securely house our majestic pterosaurs.
20931	Being located in such a warm climate presents its own unique challenges. Many dinosaurs can thrive in the heat, but for others species it can take a little longer to acclimatize. Naturally we go to great lengths to support them as they adapt and settle.
20932	While the majority of wild animals living in the desert have to tolerate a scarcity of water, we endeavor to keep our enclosures regulated with a constant supply. You may expect our dinosaurs to solely need this for drinking, but its purpose actually extends widely beyond this. 
20933	Vegetation is very scarce in the deserts, with the stark conditions making it exceptionally difficult to introduce exotic plant life. Species like cacti remain one of the best-suited plant families and have naturally adapted to efficiently conserve water. 
20934	Although this location can be incredibly picturesque, we often face strenuous environmental conditions. The temperature here can drop well below freezing, so please dress accordingly, observe our guidelines and stay safe. 
20935	Beyond the sprawling forests, lie the area's most stunning snow-tipped mountains. Many of you will have already had the chance to admire this distant backdrop on your way to the park, but if you have yet to do so then we strongly encourage you do before heading home. 
20936	Water bodies, such as lakes and rivers, are common in these parts. Thousands of years ago, these would have existed as glaciers. But as the earth warmed, these glaciers would have melted and filled their impressions with water. 
20937	The forest land that surrounds these parts are home to a plethora of animal and plant life. Where possible, we try to protect the natural landscape and allow the existing ecosystem to continue to thrive.
20938	Our temperate landscape acts as a sensational setting for our astonishing park. With warm but wet summers offset by the notably colder winters, this climate is highly diverse and perfectly complements the spectacular sights that lie inside the park. 
20939	The setting that we have chosen here for the park is not only one of great beauty, but very active and highly dynamic. The soil is very fertile and supports the growth of a wide range of trees, shrubs and other plant life. 
20940	The dense forest that lies beyond the park boundaries is home to an abundance of life. Through the canopies and down to the forest floors lie a host of animals, insects and plants. Take a moment… and listen to the forest.
20941	Nearby rainforests play a vitally important role, one that cannot be understated. They are the lungs of the planet, absorbing carbon dioxide and in turn producing oxygen for humans and animals, both extant and prehistoric. 
20942	The tropical rainforests surrounding the local area contain an amazing variety of plant and animal life; typically more than you'd find in any other biome. With a large amount of rainfall and consistently warm temperatures, the environment continues to flourish. 
20943	Please remain calm. This car has the capability to absorb the force of such impacts. 
20944	Please try not to panic. Stay calm, remain seated and do not attempt to leave the car.
20945	There is no need to be alarmed. Please remain in the vehicle and keep calm.
20946	For your safety, we ask that you keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle, and remain seated at all times.
20947	As the vehicle will often traverse across difficult terrain, it is important that you keep your seatbelts fastened.
20948	Each species that you see on this tour should be regarded as a wild animal; it is imperative that a safe distance is maintained at all times. 
20949	Should you require them, each vehicle contains night-vision goggles. Using these will allow you to continue watching our amazing animals as darkness falls
20950	"The ""high-spined lizard"" Acrocanthosaurus is a ginormous apex predator from North America, named because of the iconic raised neural spines you can see running from its neck down to its tail."
20951	A colossal carnivore from the Early Cretaceous, Acrocanthosaurus will utilize its powerful jaws to catch its prey, before inflicting slashing wounds with its razor-sharp claws.
20952	The Asset Containment Unit, also known as the ACU team, is responsible for animal sedation here in the park. Scheduled enclosure moves require substantial co-ordination to be carried out smoothly.
20953	In the event that an animal needs relocating, the ACU team is called upon to help tranquilize them before doing so, ensuring the safety of both our staff and the animal itself.
20954	Albertosaurus has around eighty large, serrated teeth; perfectly shaped for puncturing flesh and bone. Like many tyrannosaurids, the Albertosaurus bears little horn-like ornaments on its skull.
20955	The name Albertosaurus was given to this formidable carnivore after it was discovered in the freshly-established Canadian province of Alberta, which was also named in the year 1905.
20956	To many, there is no greater dinosaur than the Allosaurus. One of the first dinosaurs to have been discovered, its plentiful fossilized remains have been meticulously studied by those in the field of paleontology.  
20957	One hundred and fifty million years ago, the mighty Allosaurus reigned as a dominant predator of the Jurassic period, originally preying upon ornithopods, stegosaurids and sauropods.
20958	Amargasaurus may find itself standing in the shadows of its relatives, dwarfed by towering titanosaurs. Yet this smaller sauropod continues to draw gasps of amazement thanks to its astonishing spinal spikes.
20959	At the turn of the millennium, Amargasaurus found itself at the center of many paleontological debates. Our scientists are now beginning to unravel the mystery behind its neural spines and determine why they are so significant.
20960	With a rotund, heavily-armored body and a lethal tail club, this hardy ornithischian is well-equipped to fend off any threat. A strong sense of smell also allows it to quickly detect the presence of predators. 
20961	Ankylosaurus' thick armor consists of large knobs and oval bone plates that form within the skin. In fact, we still see this today, typically in animals such as crocodiles, armadillos and lizards.
20962	This Jurassic herbivore is one of the largest land animals to have ever roamed the Earth. Apatosaurus originally lived in North America, alongside other sauropods such as Diplodocus and Camarasaurus. 
20963	Apatosaurus feeds on plants and tree leaves, swallowing large portions without even chewing. Because its jaws lack molars, it relies on ingested stones to aid its digestion, just like many of our modern birds. 
20964	Archaeornithomimus originally lived between 70 and 96 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous, where it existed in the same time and region as the cunning carnivore Velociraptor. 
20965	Closely related to other ornithomimosaurian dinosaurs such as Gallimimus and Struthiomimus, Archaeornithomimus is a fast runner with long, strong hind-limbs and is often likened to our modern day ostrich. 
20966	Its smooth skin and rounded body help Attenborosaurus majestically glide through the water, with its elongated neck and pointed teeth proving perfect for snapping at shoaling fish.
20967	A piscivorous plesiosaur that once lived within the coastal waters of Early Jurassic England, Attenborosaurus was named after the universally-revered broadcaster Sir David Attenborough. 
20968	One hundred and twenty five million years ago, huge bodies of water with connected river deltas existed in Western Europe and North Africa, proving to be an excellent habitat for the fish-hunting Baryonyx. 
20969	Lining the long jaws of the Baryonyx are nearly one hundred tremendous teeth, perfectly suited to gripping and holding. As this spinosaurid likes to feed on fish, its teeth are perfect for ensnaring its slippery prey.
20970	Brachiosaurus uses its broad jaws and conical chisel-like teeth to crop large quantities of plant material. Its jaws are actually surprisingly weak and its movements are limited to rudimentary motions. 
20971	Unlike a number of other sauropods, the forelimbs of the Brachiosaurus are notably longer than its hind legs. This causes its back to incline and gives it an appearance that vaguely resembles the giraffe.
20972	Camarasaurus was one of the most common sauropods to have lived during the Late Jurassic. These magnificent herbivores once lived in communal herds, making it important that we try to replicate such social groupings.
20973	Camarasaurus was not one of the largest sauropods, but nor was it the smallest. This magnificent animal still weighs more than ten times the average Asian elephant. 
20974	Carcharodontosaurus is named after the Carcharodon genus of sharks, a family that includes the much-feared Great White Shark. As sharp as knives, its serrated teeth allow this carnivore to tear through flesh with astonishing ease.
20975	When Carcharodontosaurus originally roamed the Earth during the Middle Cretaceous, its African environment was warm and humid; a landscape enriched by lush rainforests and plains.
20976	The most defining feature of the Carnotaurus is the pair of thick distinctive horns protruding from above the eyes. No other prehistoric carnivore bears these unique bony, keratin-covered adornments.
20977	Despite its size, Carnotaurus is a surprisingly pacy predator, with its lighter body weight and muscular legs helping it to reach impressive speeds as it resolutely pursues its ill-fated prey. 
20978	Although you may not expect Cearadactylus to pose much of a threat, this truculent pterosaur has proved to be a remarkably unpredictable animal, with territorial dominance often lying at the heart of hostility.
20979	While the short-beaked Brazilian pterosaurs fed upon small land animals, Cearadactylus would use the thin needle-like teeth lining its elongated jaws to snatch fish as it glided above the ocean waves.
20980	"The name Ceratosaurus means ""horned lizard"", referring to the ridge-like horn on its snout. Its deep jaws contain serrated dagger-like teeth, many of which can grow up to seventeen centimeters in length."
20981	The threatening theropod Ceratosaurus once thrived as a multicontinental species, but in North America, it would have competed for prominence against the awe-inspiring apex predator Allosaurus. 
20982	Unlike some ceratopsids, the facial horns of the Chasmosaurus are relatively short. The sides of its frill also feature several small skin ossifications, helping to give Chasmosaurus a striking appearance. 
20983	"The elaborate elongated frill of the Chasmosaurus may appear solid, but in fact contains two large skeletal hollows covered by skin. These openings gave the Chasmosaurus its name, meaning; ""chasm lizard""."
20984	Chungkingosaurus is certainly well-equipped to defend itself, with two rows of pointed plates running along its back, a stupendous spike protruding from each side of its body and a tail wielding two pairs of piercing spikes.
20985	The name of this primitive Jurassic stegosaur is derived from the Chinese city Chongqing, where the earliest fossilized remains of Chungkingosaurus were discovered in its Jiangbei District.
20986	A gregarious predator from Triassic North America, the slender Coelophysis is a perfect representation of the early theropods, with a bipedal stance, an S-curved neck and sharp serrated teeth. 
20987	The hollow limb bones of Coelophysis help to make this opportunistic carnivore a nimble and tireless threat, whether it chooses to hunt alone or as part of an exceptionally deadly pack.
20988	One hundred and fifty million years ago, Compsognathus thrived as one of the top land predators in a rather unfamiliar European landscape; a dry, tropical archipelago with lagoons, beaches and coral reefs.
20989	Despite its minute size, Compsognathus is an accomplished predator. More commonly known as the 'Compy', this nimble little carnivore is one of, if not the, fastest bipedal dinosaurs to have ever existed.
20990	Here we have one of the most important buildings. The Control Center lies at the heart of the park, ensuring that all operations are running smoothly.
20991	Our advanced network allows us to monitor the location and status of each prehistoric animal in the park, right from the Control Center you see before you. 
20992	Sadly, we have an animal here that has passed away. We appreciate that such a sight can be upsetting; we will be arranging for its collection as soon as possible. 
20993	Although the presence of a deceased animal can be upsetting, an animal's body can be studied by our scientists to further our understanding of their biology. 
20994	We must act very quickly if a sick animal passes away, as there is the potential for disease to spread, especially if any surrounding carnivores attempt to eat the bodily remains.
20995	The hollow crest on the back of the Corythosaur's skull functions as an incredible resonating chamber, amplifying their marvelous calls and allowing them to communicate across great distances.
20996	The beak of the Corythosaurus is rather shallow and delicate. In the Late Cretaceous, this herbivore would have been a selective feeder, preferring to eat only the freshest fruits and softest leaves.
20997	Our transport cranes are used to move our dinosaurs carefully from one location to another. Each animal is tranquilized prior to this, to minimize any stress caused. 
20998	If we need to relocate any of our dinosaurs, we typically use a transport crane to do so. Capable of hoisting species of varying sizes and weights, these versatile vehicles ensure that each and every animal is handled with care.
20999	The herbivorous ankylosaur Crichtonsaurus originally lived in China around one hundred million years ago. The rarity of its fossilized remains today leave this primitive ankylosaur somewhat shrouded in mystery.
21000	Crichtonsaurus is certainly well equipped to protect itself, with a heavily-armored back and a bulbous club at the end of its tail, which may appear inconspicuous, but can be used to devastating effect.
21001	While many know this species as Cryolophosaurus, some affectionately refer to this Jurassic carnivore as 'Elvisaurus' because of the likeness its 'pompadour' crest bears to the hairstyle of the rock 'n' roll icon. 
21002	Long before Antarctica became the frozen desert we know today, forests covered the land and lay home to the carnivorous theropod Cryolophosaurus, the region's apex predator of the Jurassic. 
21003	Deinonychus is a highly-skilled hunter from the Early Cretaceous period. With a small, sleek body, a bird-like spine and raptorial claws on its feet, Deinonychus is an extremely agile predator.
21004	Deinonychus is a close relative of the deadly Velociraptor. Like modern day birds of prey, Deinonychus will often leap onto its target, pinning it down with its sharp, curved claws. 
21005	One of the earliest carnivores, we now know Dilophosaurus is actually poisonous, spitting its venom at its prey, causing blindness and eventually paralysis, allowing the carnivore to eat at its leisure. This makes Dilophosaurus a beautiful, but deadly addition to the park.
21006	Our Dilophosaurs are best known for their variegated neck frills, which fan outwards in a mesmerizing display of color as they prepare to attack. 
21007	The skull of the Dimorphodon is not too dissimilar to that of our modern day puffin. Yet inside this pterosaur's jaws lie a variety of fascinating denticles, including four or five longer fangs and around forty tiny lancet-like teeth. 
21008	While the head of the Dimorphodon may appear large and bulky, its weight is actually significantly lighter than you may imagine, due to thin bony partitions that separate large openings in its skull. 
21009	During its original tenure on Earth in the Late Jurassic period, Diplodocus would live on the forest edges, using its flexible neck to strip leaves from trees and plants at varying heights. 
21010	Running along the back of the Diplodocus lies a row of keratinous spines that start at the head and finish at the tip of its tail. Size aside, these spines are actually not too dissimilar to those of an iguana. 
21011	"When the fossilized remains of a bony Dracorex skull were first discovered, the spikes and knobs bore resemblance to mythical fairy-tale dragons, leading to it being named, ""Dragon King""."
21012	Dracorex shares many appearance traits with other pachycephalosaurs including the protruding spikes on the top of its head (synonymous with Stygimoloch) and a flat dome (similar to that of Homalocephale). 
21013	"This colossal titanosaurian originally lived in Argentina and is one of the largest ever known land animals. Its tremendous size and power led to it being named Dreadnoughtus, meaning ""fears nothing""."
21014	The neck bones of Dreadnoughtus contain numerous pneumatic air sacs to help limit its weight. Paleontological analysis suggests that this gives these astonishing dinosaurs an avian-like respiratory system.
21015	With no obvious defensive mechanisms, the Dryosaurus would have relied upon on its agility and speed to flee from fearsome Jurassic predators such as Ceratosaurus and Allosaurus.
21016	In addition to its teeth and a beak well-suited to cropping vegetation, Dryosaurus also has pouch-like cheek structures that prevent the herbivore from losing food while it eats.
21017	Although this bulky hadrosaur was widely distributed across western North America, Edmontosaurus was first discovered in southern Alberta, Canada and named after the province's capital city, Edmonton. 
21018	Edmontosaurus may not have a striking cranial crest like other species of large hadrosaur, but instead receives adoration for its toothless beak, with its mouth shaped similarly to that of a duck or a spoonbill. 
21019	Elasmosaurus is one of the world's most recognizable plesiosaurs, best known its incredibly long neck. It uses flipper-like limbs to paddle through the water, but is not a particularly fast swimmer.
21020	The long, thin teeth of Elasmosaurus would have played a crucial role in helping this aquatic reptile to capture its prey; a trait shared with other fish-eating reptiles like some of the avian pterosaurs.
21021	The body of this ankylosaur is covered by bony armor that features rows of round scutes, with such banding allowing Euoplocephalus to move around with a reasonable degree of freedom.
21022	Euoplocephalus is not able to reach great heights when defensively swinging its club-like tail, and will instead attempt to deter large predatory carnivores by targeting the shins or feet of its assailants. 
21023	Gallimimus is one of the largest ornithomimid dinosaurs. Despite its size, this theropod is capable of running at impressive speeds, using its long, strong legs to cover a lot of ground with each stride.
21024	"The name Gallimimus means ""chicken mimic"", referring to the similarities that its neck vertebrae bears to Galliformes such as turkeys, pheasants and, of course, chickens. "
21025	The broad-winged, long-jawed Geosternbergia predates its closest relative, the Pteranodon, with a characterful upright crest differentiating it from its descendants.
21026	The beautiful cranial crest of Geosternbergia only materializes as the pterosaur matures and enters adulthood, with these frontal bones developing into a multitude of different sizes and shapes.
21027	The gargantuan skull of Giganotosaurus has been known to surpass lengths of one point six meters, exceeding the size of a Tyrannosaurus Rex skull and even the height of the average human being.
21028	Despite having very short arms, the hands of Giganotosaurus each wield three knife-like claws. Giganotosaurus also boasts a truly powerful bite force and an impressive array of sharp, slicing teeth.
21029	Gigantspinosaurus is a Chinese herbivore that first lived during the Late Jurassic. With broad hips, robust forelimbs and a relatively large head, it is not as primitive as some other species of stegosaur.
21030	While the dorsal plates that run down its back are relatively small, Gigantspinosaurus bears two spectacular shoulder spines that help protect this stegosaur from predatory threats.
21031	We hope that you are having an extraordinary time here at the park. If, however, you need a little downtime, then we have a variety of entertainment facilities just for you.
21032	Not all of the buildings you've seen are facilities for our park staff. We are proud to offer some splendid entertainment options to each and every one of you visiting us today.
21033	If you need a bite to eat, or perhaps a refreshing drink, then why not head on over to one of our fabulous shops later on?
21034	Should anyone find themselves with a stomach growling louder than a dinosaur, then we'd be delighted to welcome you to one of our wonderful guest facilities.
21035	Behind the tall gates of each hatchery lies state-of-the-art equipment, ground-breaking technology and world-class staff working 'round the clock to bring prehistory to the modern day.
21036	Hatcheries like this allow us to safely introduce our dinosaurs to their enclosures, either having been incubated here on-site or having arrived from outside of the park.
21037	The life of every avian reptile begins with an egg. From excavation to embryo, it is a truly miraculous process to bring each soaring species to life. 
21038	Before we introduce a flying reptile to its aviary, our team of experts work tirelessly to nurture each animal and ensure it is fully prepared for release.
21039	Each marine reptile reared at the park is housed in a hatchery, where its growth and development can be monitored by our hard-working team.
21040	This is one of our marine hatcheries, where our aquatic reptiles are cared for before eventually being transferred out to their enclosure.
21041	Despite possessing a great degree of speed and agility, Herrerasaurus is considered to be a rather primitive predator and was unlikely to have topped the food chain of Triassic Argentina. 
21042	While many dinosaurs tower above us and others scamper below, the skilled hunter Herrerasaurus stands eye to eye with us humans… but hopefully, this not a situation you will find yourself in. 
21043	Although the flat-topped skull of Homalocephale would sometimes be used for butting heads, it is theorized that this species would occasionally use their broad hips to engage in flank-butting.
21044	Homalocephale may be a relatively small species of pachycephalosaur, but its large eyes and long legs means that this Mongolian herbivore is well equipped to identify and escape danger.
21045	For those of you wanting to extend your time at the park, why not consider staying at our five-star, on-site hotel? No need to spend extra time travelling to and from the park. Let discovery lie at your doorstep
21046	Five-star luxury awaits you in our glorious hotel. After a busy day enjoying the park, you'll be sure to need a well-deserved rest. So why not see what our incredible hotels have to offer?
21047	A double row of small spike-like plates line the back of Huayangosaurus, transitioning into pairs of long spikes that run along its tail. However, these are all often overshadowed by the imposing spike that protrudes from each shoulder. 
21048	The Chinese herbivore Huayangosaurus preceded its famous North American relative Stegosaurus by more than 20 million years. The Stegosaur evolution would see many changes unfold, including the loss of teeth. 
21049	Many millions of years have passed since these prehistoric animals first roamed the Earth, yet inside each of these predators lies an inherent need to hunt. Watch carefully and note the patience, precision and proficiency of these deadly hunters.
21050	Like our modern day predators, these fascinating animals will hunt to secure a succulent meal for themselves. They can approach with a subtle silence and strike with inconceivable force.
21051	Where it is safe and sustainable to do so, we like to try and recreate the predator-prey scenarios that carnivores would have experienced millions of years ago. After all, some animals don't want to be fed, they want to hunt.
21052	Presented with the profile of an Ichthyosaurus, one could easily mistake it for a prehistoric dolphin or swordfish. It is in fact neither; rather, a supple aquatic reptile far removed from lineages of the land. 
21053	Under the rippling waves of the Jurassic waters lived the masterful marine hunter, Ichthyosaurus, with large round eyes providing attuned vision and solid ear bones that can sense subtle vibrations in the water.
21054	Iguanodon is one species you would not want to find yourself grappling with. Sporting a large spike on each thumb, this formidable ornithopod can deliver a powerful, puncturing blow. 
21055	In the early nineteenth century, Iguanodon solidified its place within the records of prehistory, becoming just the second species of dinosaur to have ever been discovered and named. 
21056	A ginormous predator with astonishing intelligence, unfathomable strength and the miraculous ability to conceal itself, Indominus Rex adds a thrilling new chapter to the chronicles of prehistory. 
21057	An amalgamation of the most fearsome, cunning and dangerous predators to have ever walked the Earth, Indominus Rex is a spectacular hybrid unlike anything the world has ever seen. 
21058	The Indoraptor is arguably the deadliest predator mankind has ever known. A lethal hunter with a chilling demeanor and an unrivalled aggression; the Indoraptor is a scientific sensation.
21059	The Indoraptor is an exceptionally ferocious hybrid, with terrifying teeth, sickle-like claws and a piercing stare. Only here can you find yourself coming face-to-face with the epitome of deadliness. 
21060	Lying at the core of our park is the towering Innovation Center. This building offers a multitude of attractions designed for both your entertainment and your education.
21061	Here we have the magnificent Innovation Center. Before your park visit ends, make sure you take the time to explore this tremendous building and all of its miraculous offerings. 
21062	Kentrosaurus may be one of the smaller species of Stegosaur, but this Tanzanian herbivore can swing its spiked tail at speeds of at least thirty miles per hour, delivering a piercing and shattering blow.
21063	Kentrosaurus possesses a long, highly flexible tail, resulting in its center of mass resting just in front of the hips; a trait that you would normally expect to see in bipedal dinosaurs.
21064	A menacing marine reptile with an excellent sense of smell, Liopleurodon was the established apex predator of the prehistoric seas during the Jurassic period. 
21065	Liopleurodon is a short-necked plesiosaur with a crushing bite and four strong flippers that can be used to great effect during an ambush, powerfully propelling itself towards an unsuspecting victim. 
21066	A fish-eating pterosaur from northeastern Brazil, Maaradactylus is a flying reptile perhaps best known for its incredible denticulation, bearing at least 35 pairs of teeth in its upper jaw alone. 
21067	The tall-crested, toothed pterosaur Maaradactylus was named after the daughter of a Brazilian tribe's chief; a legend that told of sorcery transforming the girl into a river monster that would prey upon local fishermen. 
21068	"Maiasaura, the ""good mother lizard"", is a North American herbivore well-known for protecting its nesting colonies. These hadrosaurs would remain in tight-knit social groups, sheltering their eggs and juveniles. "
21069	Maiasaura has no obvious means of defence against large carnivores. During the Early Cretaceous, these dinosaurs would have formed large herds to help one another detect predatorial threats.
21070	While Majungasaurus may not have been the largest carnivorous theropod, it ruled the land of Late Cretaceous Madagascar and established itself as the region's apex predator.
21071	Originating in Madagascar's Mahajanga Province, a locale that would inspire the naming of Majungasaurus, this Cretaceous hunter will use its powerful neck and jaws to bring down its prey.
21072	Mamenchisaurus is a colossal sauropod from the Late Jurassic, with a gigantic neck that ranks it among the tallest dinosaurs to have ever been recreated by genetic engineering.
21073	An enormous sauropod from China, Mamenchisaurus towers above almost all other species of dinosaur. Yet despite their astounding size, these majestic animals move with phenomenal grace. 
21074	"The catalyst in the advent of paleontology, the ""great lizard"" Megalosaurus was the very first dinosaur to ever be named and has become the subject of fascination for hundreds of years. "
21075	Once regarded as the definitive prehistoric carnivore, Megalosaurus commanded the coastal chain of islands of Jurassic England, striking fear into its prey with a muscular frame and sharp, curved teeth.
21076	Under the skin of Metriacanthosaurus lies a series of neural spines running along its back. This gives the dinosaur a slight hump, similar to that seen in the transatlantic theropod Acrocanthosaurus. 
21077	A threatening predator from Late Jurassic England, Metriacanthosaurus will typically tolerate the presence of smaller species but can often become hostile towards other carnivores of its size.
21078	Mosasaurus was thought to have hunted near the surface of the water where it preyed on anything it could sink its teeth into, including turtles, large fish and even smaller Mosasaurs. 
21079	A gargantuan marine predator, Mosasaurus utilizes the power of its large paddle-like tail to quickly propel itself, unleashing a sudden attack to fatally incapacitate its prey. 
21080	Muttaburrasaurus is one of the most popular species of dinosaur from Australia. This herbivore is recognized for the bulging nasal muzzle that allows it to vocalize in such a truly beautiful way.
21081	Rather than grinding down its food, Muttaburrasaurus will use its teeth to shear. Parallels have been drawn between this ornithopod and the ceratopsid dinosaurs, which also consume vegetation in this manner. 
21082	The rounded horns of Nasutoceratops are often likened to our modern-day cattle, with its short hollow snout also contributing to the extraordinary appearance of this smaller ceratopsid. 
21083	The first fossilized remains of Nasutoceratops were discovered in Utah's Kaiparowits Formation, which, during the Late Cretaceous, would have been a wet and humid landscape, full of swamps and floodplains.
21084	Inside the wide muzzle of the African sauropod Nigersaurus lies an incredible arrangement of teeth; over five hundred teeth are arranged in single lines and replaced at a rapid rate of once per fortnight.
21085	"The broad jaws of the Nigersaurus allow it to gather large amounts of vegetation with just a single bite, leading to this small low-browsing sauropod being lovingly nicknamed, ""the Mesozoic Lawn Mower""."
21086	"Nodosaurus was one of the first armored dinosaurs to be discovered in North America, receiving its name, meaning ""knobbed lizard"", from acclaimed paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in eighteen eighty nine. "
21087	While Nodosaurus does display an incredibly well-protected back, the bony armor does not extend to the belly, meaning that this herbivore would be extremely vulnerable if upended by a predator.
21088	"Originally from the Russian Far East, Olorotitan is a graceful hadrosaur with a long ""swan-like"" neck and a prominent hatchet-shaped skull crest that is often visually vibrant in color. "
21089	Like other large hadrosaurs, Olorotitan sports a vivid crest upon its head. Not only does this hollow sonorous chamber aid its vocal communication, but it helps them to visually identify one another.
21090	Ouranosaurus is a rather social herbivore from West Africa. A close relative of the duck-billed hadrosaurs, Ouranosaurus would have once inhabited the inland floodplains of Cretaceous Niger. 
21091	The bulging hump that you see on the back of Ouranosaurus conceals a series of tall neural spines, coated by skin and supported by muscle tissue and fat; not too dissimilar to that of a bison.
21092	"Pachycephalosaurus, the ""thick-headed lizard"" from Cretaceous North America, is a bipedal herbivore best known for the remarkable twenty-five centimeter deep dome that grows on top of its head."
21093	The thick bony dome that crowns the skull of Pachycephalosaurus not only protects the brain, but allows it to offensively inflict a powerful head-butt without sustaining an injury itself.
21094	Pachyrhinosaurus is often admired for the bulbous, bony boss that sits upon its snout. A pair of parting horns rest atop the herbivore's frill, which also contributes to a highly unique silhouette. 
21095	A North American relative of Styracosaurus and Triceratops, Pachyrhinosaurus is a beaked herbivore with strong herding instincts that will see it naturally pledge loyalty to its fellow ceratopsians. 
21096	Our plants often encourage coexistence among herbivorous species. While taller dinosaurs like the sauropods can feed from the elevated canopies, browsing grazers can simultaneously feed at ground-level.
21097	As our tour continues, keep an eye out for different varieties of prehistoric flora. Our paleo-botanical research teams have cultivated these to enrich the diets of our herbivorous population.
21098	With the help of a paleo-botanical team, prehistoric plant life can be biogenetically engineered and then carefully introduced to the park, forming a sustainable source of food for our hungry herbivores.
21099	Although our mobile veterinary units can attend to minor injuries or diseases while the animal remains in its enclosure, sometimes it is necessary to transfer them back to the facility.
21100	If any of our animals are showing signs of illness or have sustained an injury, our paleo-veterinary team are on hand to help provide the necessary treatment.
21101	Parasaurolophus is best known for its extraordinary head adornment. The crest curves upwards and back over the skull, connecting this hollow structure to the hadrosaur's nostrils. 
21102	"When the fossilized remains of Parasaurolophus were first discovered, it was believed to be a close relative of the hadrosaur species, Saurolophus, leading to it being named ""near crested lizard"". "
21103	"While you may initially only count three horns on the ""five-horned face"" of Pentaceratops, the fourth and fifth are actually the stumpy, pointed cheek bones at the base of its frill. "
21104	Weighing as much as a full-grown elephant, the Pentaceratops is a lofty ceratopsid with a spectacular frill. Faced with a threat, it will use its imposing facial horns to fend away danger.
21105	Just as Tyrannosaurus and Pteranodon are celebrated as archetypal species of the land and skies, the long-necked Plesiosaurus is one of the most iconic marine reptiles of the prehistoric seas. 
21106	The lengthy neck of Plesiosaurus grants this predatory reptile an extended reach to strike its prey. Paired with a patient approach, Plesiosaurus can prove to be a highly effective aquatic hunter. 
21107	As is seen in other nodosaurs, much of the Polacanthus' body is covered with bony osteoderms and spikes. However, this particular species has a defining sacral shield; a fused sheet of bone over its pelvis.
21108	Polacanthus is a robust and heavily-armored nodosaurid dinosaur from the Isle of Wight. Fossilized remains have typically been poorly preserved, making it a fascinating species for our scientists to study.
21109	Supplying the park with adequate power is one of the greatest challenges that we face. Thanks to the fantastic infrastructure we have here though, our daily operations can run exceptionally smoothly. 
21110	Running a park like this requires a huge amount of energy to be generated each and every day. We are proud to be utilizing renewable energy sources for many facilities around the park, as we look to reduce our carbon footprint.
21111	The most defining feature of the Proceratosaurus is its brightly-colored nasal crest, and the discovery of this attractive appendage has led to much discussion and deliberation between paleontologists.
21112	Proceratosaurus was first thought to be an ancestor of the Late Jurassic carnivore Ceratosaurus, but has since been reclassified as an early member of the Tyrannosaur family, preceding the giant Tyrannosaurs of the Cretaceous. 
21113	One of the most iconic traits of the majestic Pteranodon is the protruding skull crest. Straight and narrow, it angles back from the rear of the skull and aids the pterosaur when maneuvering in flight.
21114	The long, slender beak of the Pteranodon is comprised of solid, bony margins that project from the base of the jaws and end in a sharp point. This gives these pterosaurs the ability to masterfully scoop with their beaks to capture fish.
21115	As T. rex commanded the continent of North America, across the Pacific Ocean lived its Chinese relative Qianzhousaurus, a somewhat undersized tyrannosaur that could still overpower its prey with ease. 
21116	"While the name Qianzhousaurus remains unfamiliar to many, its popularity continues to rise thanks to the nickname, ""Pinocchio rex"", inspired by this Asian tyrannosaur's long, thin snout."
21117	The park's ranger teams play a crucial role in ensuring that our prehistoric animals are well cared for and their enclosures well-maintained all year round. 
21118	With the aid of their all-terrain four-by-four vehicles, the ranger teams are able to cover the vast majority of the park site. These hardy vehicles deal superbly with rugged terrain, shallow water bodies and dense foliage.
21119	Keeping raptors contained, safely and securely, is no easy feat. This maximum security containment unit is reinforced with electric fencing to ensure that no dinosaur can get in or out. 
21120	The raptor pen; a state-of-the-art containment unit designed to securely house the most cunning of carnivores. Electrified chain-link fencing topped with barbed wire ensures that escape is impossible.
21121	Unlike members of the ankylosaur family, nodosaurids like Sauropelta do not have a heavy tail club to use as a weapon. Its tail is, however, characteristically long and forms nearly half its body length. 
21122	With a heavily armored collar and huge protracting spines, the slow-moving Sauropelta was well protected against agile Cretaceous predators that would try to jump onto the back of their prey.
21123	It is here at the Science Center that our experts process the fossils discovered by our expedition teams. Recovered from all over the world, these fascinating fossils help us to piece together the DNA profiles for each of our prehistoric species.
21124	Our paleobotany team is based here in the Science Center alongside our talented research specialists. Every day we are making new discoveries and further advancements that allow us to better care for the magnificent animals you see in the park. 
21125	Please take note of the building you see here; the shelter. This secure structure has been built to offer shielded protection from any anomalous dangers.
21126	In the event of a high-risk storm or security anomaly, please pay attention to the broadcast announcements and proceed to a shelter like the one you see before you. 
21127	One unexpected source of sickness and disease is actually the enclosure feeders. Ranger teams can play a vital role in combating the spread of illness by disinfecting the feeders and monitoring the health status of every dinosaur. 
21128	Every animal on Earth is at risk to some degree when it comes to sickness or disease. The dinosaurs here at the park are no exception, especially as their prehistoric bodies must adjust to our modern day environments. 
21129	Each dinosaur here at the park faces a considerable challenge to strengthen its immune system. We try to aid them as much as possible with the administration of vaccines, eradicating the danger posed by known diseases. 
21130	A series of forward-curving hornlets give Sinoceratops' frill an imposing crown-like appearance. Low knobs can also be seen running along the top of the frill and are in fact truly unique to this species.
21131	"The discovery of Sinoceratops was of significant importance, as it was the first ceratopsid to have originated in China. The genus name Sinoceratops even translates as ""Chinese horned face""."
21132	Each dinosaur group you see in the park has a socially-accepted leader. For some species, this leader is recognized as the group's Alpha, but it may find itself being challenged regularly to retain its status. 
21133	The most dominant dinosaur in a group is recognized as the leader. However, not all changes in leadership are the result of conflict; some of the more social dinosaur species achieve the dominant status through intimidation alone.
21134	You may well witness dinosaurs attempting to establish dominance while you are on this tour. While it can be worrying and distressing to witness, these standoffs are vitally important to the way these animals select an Alpha. 
21135	Spinosaurus is one of the largest meat-eating dinosaurs to have ever walked the Earth. This breathtaking North African predator is best known for its stunning sail and long crocodile-like jaws. 
21136	Spinosaurus once lived in the coastal wetlands and mangrove forests of Egypt and Morocco, where it would not only feed upon fish and turtles, but target pterosaurs and plesiosaurs. 
21137	Stegosaurus is one of the world's best-known dinosaurs. This Jurassic herbivore possesses two rows of upright plates running from its neck, all along its back and down towards a spiked tail.
21138	When faced with the threat of an almighty Allosaurus during the Late Jurassic, Stegosaurus would have protected itself with swift and powerful swings of the spiked thagomizer at the end of its tail.
21139	Struthiomimus is an ostrich-like ornithopod from North America. Although many species of carnivorous theropod have stunted forelimbs, this bipedal dinosaur possesses proportionally long hands.
21140	Struthiomimus is capable of great speed and, with the aid of its long stiff tail, can alter its direction with ease. This agility would have proved essential to its survival when fleeing Cretaceous predators.
21141	Stygimoloch is best known for its spiked skull, which prevented Cretaceous predators from trying to bite its neck. These protruding horns inspired the name; 'demon from the river Styx'. 
21142	The stocky Stygimoloch is quite wary by nature. These spiky-headed dinosaurs are most aggressive towards their own kind, with their bony domes cushioning their brains as they charge at one another.
21143	The prominent nasal horn and distinctive frill spikes make the Styracosaurus a very popular species of Ceratopsid. However, unlike the Triceratops, adult Styracosaurs do lack large horns on their brow.
21144	The 'spiked lizard' Styracosaurus is an unmistakable Ceratopsid herbivore from Cretaceous Canada. As well as the large horns on its snout and frill, it has two pointed cheek bones, known as jugals.
21145	One hundred and twelve million years ago, Suchomimus dwelled within the freshwater floodplains and river deltas of Niger in West Africa, scavenging for meat and hunting for fish.
21146	The long, narrow skull of the Suchomimus bears a strong resemblance to our modern day crocodiles. This African hunter's narrow jaws wield over one hundred and twenty finely-serrated teeth; perfect for catching fish. 
21147	Across the pterosaur family, we see considerable variety when we study the size, shape and coloration of their head crests. However, very few can rival the beauty of Tapejara's sensational semicircular crest.
21148	Like many modern birds and reptiles, Tapejara have scleral rings; bones that support the eyes and tend to indicate that these prehistoric pterosaurs could have been evenly active throughout day and night.
21149	One common misconception that many guests have is that different species cannot cohabit with one another. As long as neither feels threatened by the other, animals can happily coexist in the same enclosure.
21150	Many of the dinosaurs that we know best were once separated by millions of years. In some cases, the period of time between the existence of one species and another was greater than the time that separated them from humans.
21151	One of the most testing aspects of running the park has been discovering the compatibility between species. Cohabitation can allow us to keep a greater variety of dinosaurs here at the park, but with it comes the greater risk of contention.
21152	Many factors can influence a dinosaur's territorial comfort. It must be content with its environmental landscape, its social grouping and the amount of space it shares with any species it perceives to be a threat.
21153	If an animal begins to exhibit signs of territorial distress, it is important that we act fast and attempt to identify a feasible way to segregate the incompatible species before conflict arises.
21154	Not all dinosaurs will express territorial discomfort in the same way. Our behavioral experts have become finely attuned to the earliest indications of unhappiness that stem from an animal's territorial unrest.
21155	When a dinosaur deems it necessary to protect its territory, it may begin vocalizing in a provocative or intimidating manner. Roars, growls, hisses and barks are all typical expressions of this defensiveness and can be directed towards dinosaurs and humans alike.
21156	While many of the dinosaurs you'll see today will have grown accustomed to their surrounding company, there may be some competition for territorial dominance, which will see them adopt a very different bodily posture.
21157	Some of our more aggressive animals do not shy away from conflict and you may well see them engaging in fights. Although we do not want them to sustain injuries, conflict resolution may be an unavoidable necessity for them to establish social structure. 
21158	Animals have an innate desire to establish their own territory. Many will do so amicably, some through the use of force. This need has existed for millions of years and finally we are getting an amazing look into prehistoric patterns of dinosaur behavior. 
21159	Although dinosaurs will attempt to claim an area as their own relatively quickly, you may see some of them venturing out cautiously as they look to expand their territory. This can escalate rapidly and occasionally require intervention from our park teams. 
21160	Many guests will see a dinosaur moving around its enclosure, seemingly wandering without purpose. In fact, this is a common territorial process of great importance to the dinosaurs as they acclimatize to life here at the park.
21161	"It is the tremendous skull of Torosaurus that unsurprisingly garners the most attention. With hornlets running along the edging, the elongated frill features two large openings, leading to its naming of; ""perforated lizard""."
21162	There are many similarities between Torosaurus and Triceratops; both have two prominent brow horns and a shorter nasal horn. They also originated from very similar locations within North America. 
21163	There are few species of dinosaur more recognizable than the archetypal ceratopsid Triceratops. Depictions of this horned herbivore squaring off against its fierce rival Tyrannosaurus rex have captured the imaginations of adults and children alike for many a decade. 
21164	Triceratops is best known for its three protrusive facial horns. These adornments are not just for display purposes; the brow horns in particular can inflict considerable damage to any dinosaur that dares to provoke it.
21165	"The initial discovery of a single tooth gave Troodon its name; ""wounding tooth"". Curved like those of a carnivore, but serrated like an herbivore's, the Troodon's teeth puzzled paleontologists for many years."
21166	Our Troodontids may be small, but they are daunting and deadly. Watching with its bewitching eyes, Troodon will strike with sickle-shaped claws and disarm its prey with a swift and venomous bite. 
21167	Like many other pterosaurs, the Tropeognathus has long, thin wings that were originally used for dynamic soaring. This would allow them to conserve energy by passing over ocean waves to pick up speed.
21168	Tropeognathus is a large pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous period. Boasting a highly impressive wingspan, this avian reptile would glide over water bodies and snatch fish from the water.
21169	Tsintaosaurus is a species of hollow-crested hadrosaur from the Shandong Province of China. With a duck-bill snout and strong teeth for chewing plants, this herbivore will feed upon a variety of vegetation. 
21170	Like other hadrosaurs of its kind, the Tsintaosaurus is able to switch between bipedal and quadrupedal stances with ease. This allows it to browse vegetation at different heights and evade predatory threats if necessary.
21171	Below the surface of North America's oceans lay one of the largest known species of mosasaur, Tylosaurus. Its tremendous size granted it the status of apex predator and, given the chance, it would even target land-based dinosaurs.
21172	Not only were the puncturing teeth of the Tylosaurus a great threat to its fellow sea dwellers, but its elongated snout also posed a considerable danger to its prey, ramming its target at high speeds to stun it.
21173	"Tyrannosaurus rex, the ""tyrant lizard"", needs no introduction. This illustrious theropod is one of the world's most iconic dinosaurs and among the largest land carnivores to have ever walked the Earth."
21174	Tyrannosaurus rex boasts one of the greatest bite forces ever recorded. Not only can this powerful predator's jaws easily shatter bones, but a single bite from T. rex is enough to crush a car.
21175	Velociraptor is a highly skilled hunter, armed with recurved claws that are perfect for pinning and slashing their prey. Through coordinated, carefully calculated attacks, raptors can take down large targets with exceptional efficiency. 
21176	These pack-hunting predators are agile and intellectual carnivores. Dangerous alone, and truly deadly in groups, Velociraptors can outpace and outwit almost any victim they cast their eyes upon.
21177	Our viewing buildings offer the best chance of getting a good glimpse at our prehistoric animals. There is no need to peer through fencing here; these buildings offer unparalleled views.
21178	If you're looking for the best viewpoint of our stunning animals, then make sure you head to your nearest viewing building. 
21179	After you disembark, we heartily encourage you to make your way to the Visitor Center. Discovery lies at the heart of the park and we invite you to join us on a journey.
21180	Our famed Visitor Center offers a multitude of extraordinary opportunities Take one step into this sensational building and you will find yourself in a time when dinosaurs ruled the Earth.
21181	The concrete fences you see here make it possible to securely house the largest and most dangerous of dinosaurs known to man. Unlike the other enclosure fences you may see in the park, they cannot be electrified, but offer exceptional durability.
21182	Along with the privilege of caring for these creatures comes the great responsibility of ensuring that our guests and animals are safe. Tall, thick and sturdy, concrete walls offer unparalleled levels of security.
21183	The intelligence displayed by some of these dinosaurs has far surpassed the expectations of our experts. Systematic and cunning, we have yet to see any creature strike the same electrified fence panel twice. 
21184	Although we understand that you may wish to get as close as possible to these creatures, these fences here in the park have been electrically reinforced for good reason. Please refrain from getting too close to the fencing.
21185	While we endeavour to provide our dinosaurs with the best habitats possible, it is important that the necessary precautions are taken to keep them housed safely within their enclosures. The fencing used here at the park is among the best available in the world.
21186	One of our top priorities at the park is finding the perfect balance between safety and visibility. Our fencing allows us not only to give our guests the best chance possible at getting a glimpse of our mesmerizing creatures, but to keep them secure and protected.
21187	During most of your tour, the appropriate information will be automatically selected and displayed for you. Simply touch the area of the screen displaying the appropriate icon.

21196	Please ensure you have collected all of your belongings before you disembark. Enjoy your time at Jurassic World.
21197	Right on time. To replicate the predatory encounters these animals would have experienced in the wild, we offer them live bait. Watch these magnificent predators as they stalk and strike their prey.
21198	The live bait feeders you see are an important part of maintaining the wellbeing of our animals. They provide stimuli that allow our carnivorous species to safely engage their natural instincts for hunting prey.
21199	In order to better stimulate our prehistoric animals, we like to introduce live food to their enclosures. Watch as nature takes its course. Those with sensitive stomachs may wish to look away for a few moments.

21390	The lagoon we have here was designed to house our marine reptiles. These mesmerizing animals are not actually dinosaurs, although they did live during similar ages.
21391	Beneath the surface of the water, deep in the depths of prehistory, lie magnificent marine marvels. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be amazed.
21392	Just like their land-based counterparts, these aquatic animals are perfectly suited to their environment, gliding through the seas with incredible ease.
21393	There is nothing quite like feeding time at our marine reptile enclosure. Keep an eye on our feeding timetable and join us for an absolutely breathtaking display. 
21394	This lagoon is home to the prehistoric life of the seas. Take a moment to leave land and air behind and dive into a mysterious marine environment.
21395	Thank you for joining us here today at our astonishing lagoon facility. Are you ready to find out what lies underneath the waves? We hope so, because you may well get wet.
21396	Although many marine species are solely confined to the water, some predatory animals possess enough strength to propel themselves out of the water and unleash a devastating attack.
21397	The marine reptiles you see before you were once part of a remarkable underwater realm, with food chains and ecosystems often dominated by animals like these.
21398	When these animals first inhabited the Earth's oceans, the prehistoric seas were also home to a myriad of fish, ammonites and other water-dwelling lifeforms.
21399	The temperatures of the prehistoric waters were thought to have been significantly warmer than they are today. With this in mind, we try to maintain similar temperature levels for them here in the park.
21400	The whales and sharks that grace our seas today are often dwarfed by some of the colossal aquatic species that held dominion over the oceans millions of years ago. 
21401	Deep below the gently lapping waves of the primeval seas, these animals were enduring a perpetual fight for survival; an oceanic kingdom where any predator could become prey.
21402	OK, folks, let's see if they're still hungry.
21403	They're a little shy, so be nice and give them a hand when they appear.
21404	I wonder if they're interested in having something to eat…
21405	It is our responsibility to try and create an environment that feels as natural as possible for these dinosaurs. Adding rocks and plant life allow us to better simulate a prehistoric environment and make the dinosaurs feel right at home. 
21406	The introduction of rocks, trees and shrubbery continues to prove very popular with both our guests and our animals. Set against a spectacular scenic backdrop, we are delighted to be bringing prehistory to the modern world.
21407	When it comes to plant life, not only do we have to consider the animals, but we have to be mindful of the local ecosystem. We must select trees and plant life that can thrive in the conditions here and we also have a duty not to risk introducing invasive species. 
21408	The plant life that we introduce to the animals can prove to be a highly useful source of nutrients. Obviously, we have to take great care to make sure that each plant species is safe to consume before we expose the dinosaurs to them. 
21409	Please remain calm. Each truck is reinforced to withstand heavy impacts.
21410	Please do not panic. Remain seated inside the truck and await further instructions.
21411	There is no need to be alarmed. This truck is built to withstand any force inflicted by a dinosaur. 
21412	You are welcome to take photos during the tour, but we ask that you avoid the use of flash photography, as it can startle the animals. 
21413	Please keep your seatbelts fastened while the truck is moving, as we may encounter difficult terrain along our route.
21414	Please be aware that loud noises can disturb our animals. Please refrain from making any sudden sounds.
21415	Our animals have extremely delicate diets that require expert regulation. Please refrain from feeding our prehistoric animals. 
21416	Operating in the desert may effectively eradicate the threats that rain storms pose, but here we face an alternate threat in the form of sand storms. These dangerous conditions can cause respiratory and vision problems for both dinosaurs and guests.
21417	Sand storms not only present a hazard for our park teams at ground level, but make vehicular flight considerably more risky. Both our drivers and pilots receive training in adverse weather conditions so that they can attend to an emergency even in the fiercest of storms.
21418	Although we strive to make our facilities as robust as possible, sand storms have proved to be disruptive in the past. Vehicular engine failure and power generator outages may result in temporary interruptions to our services, so please bear with us if such circumstances arise. 
21419	Snow storms present a considerable hazard here at the park, for guests, staff and animals. Should conditions worsen during your visit to the park, please pay attention to the instructions communicated to you via our announcement system.
21420	Even our most versatile and durable park vehicles struggle in the testing conditions of a snow storm. Not only are our park team vehicles hindered in such situations, but the tour vehicle you are using today may be affected too. 
21421	As weather conditions intensify, it becomes increasingly hard for our staff and automated systems to track our animals. You may well encounter some interruptions to our usual services while we attend to routine security measures, but we hope to keep any disruptions to a minimum. 
21422	We try to make your visit to the park as safe and memorable as possible. However, strong storms have been known to occur here, so we have measures in place to protect our guests in what could prove to be dangerous and unnerving conditions. 
21423	Severe storms do occasionally pass through this park and can inflict substantial damage upon our buildings and facilities. Please do remain vigilant during such conditions and be cautious of any flying debris while the strong wind conditions are active.
21424	Our animals do tend to become quite agitated when a large storm or tornado occurs, which may be worrying or distressing for some guests. Please try not to worry; our park teams will be on-hand to deal with any animals exhibiting signs of distress. 
21425	Chaotic tropical storms have been known to occur in these parts. Please be mindful of the dangers posed by these storms and remember that conditions can change with alarming speed. If you have any concerns, please speak to a member of staff.
21426	Hurricanes can cause significant disruption and destruction. It is not our intention to worry you, but to help prepare you for potentially dangerous conditions. Please listen out for safety instructions during such adverse weather.
21427	Here at the park, it is our duty to mitigate damage and injury during a hurricane strike. Our weather forecasts provide us with a small degree of advanced warning, allowing us time to relay any important instructions to our park guests.
21428	Okay, I’m setting the coordinates of the animal’s last sighting. Start tracking it there.
21429	What you’re after is definitely bigger than a goat. And more deadly. So move carefully. But move.
21430	When you locate the animal, call in a Capture Team chopper, they can help tranq the target. A Transport Team can then move it to a suitable enclosure.
21431	Nice job on that capture and contain.
21432	Because of you, that wild dinosaur is now back under our control.
21433	Outstanding. You can definitely track the biggest of game. Who rules the earth now, huh?
21434	You have opportunities you’re not taking advantage of. Perhaps you should take a look.
21435	There is a tracking mission awaiting your review and action.
21436	If you need something to do, take a look at this tracking opportunity.
